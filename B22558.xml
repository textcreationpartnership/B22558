            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>Chriſtian and pious Readers,</head>
                  <p>IF you have but to any conſiderable meaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the Writings of our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers either of late, or formerly, againſt the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> you will find that they have abundantly proved them to be, if not an apoſtatical and falſe, yet at leaſt an erroneous and Schiſmatical Church, and one that hath little cauſe ſo to boaſt and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie her ſelf upon her pretended Priviledges of Truth and Infallibility above others as ſhe doth.</p>
                  <p>That many Worthies of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> both of former times, and of late, have written ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to have convinced the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Partie of their groſs and palpable Errors, and to prove that they are nothing leſs than what they pretend to, viz. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, or ſuch as are not nor can be obnoxious to miſtake, any one that hath read their Writings, and is but maſter of an ordinary meaſure of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Ingenuity and Impartiality, will confeſs.</p>
                  <p>That many Worthies of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> both of former and latter Times have ſufficiently, yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly proved the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if not wholly an apoſtatical and falſe, yet at leaſt a moſt groſly erroneous and corrupt Church, no man of ordinary Ingenuity and Reaſon will deny. To wave what hath been written for their Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:199459:3"/>by thoſe more Ancient, one would think that what ſome excellent Men of late, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Dr. <hi>Tiliotſon</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> have written againſt them, would have put to utter ſilence their Ignorance and Folly; And that they would not have had a word to plead for their Infallibility, who have been found to err ſo groſly and palpably concerning the Faith in many the weightieſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Goſpel as they have done; but that they would have acknowledged the mighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Truth, and have ſaid, <hi>it is worthy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</hi> But ſo little prevalent with them is the Light of Truth, though ſhining never ſo bright both in the Scriptures and Reaſon, that their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though never ſo much brayed thereby, will not depart from them. They ſtill hold as faſt as ſtiffly their groſly irrational, and anti-ſcriptural and abſurd Doctrines of Image-worſhip, Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, Indulgencies, Angel-worſhip, Saint-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or Invocation of them, Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ever, and will do. All Arguments drawn from Scripture and Reaſon, yea from common Senſe it ſelf, are but as Braſs with the Leviathan, they eſteem them all but as rotten Wood.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, <hi>Whence or how came this Spirit of Infatuation upon them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why the Apoſtle will tell you, <hi>2 Theſ. 2.10.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, <hi>This is an hard ſaying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No not at all. If men ſhew themſelves ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, as not to be ruled by any thing whatſoever
<pb facs="tcp:199459:3"/>that God hath appointed for their right-Ordering and Guidance, it is evident that they are wicked as well as abſurd, <hi>2 Theſſ. 3.2.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will go on to ask, <hi>How comes this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation to be ſo inveterate with them and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be removed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This our excellent Author in this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe will tell you. <hi>1.</hi> They take it for an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Maxime (than which yet there is nothing more falſe) <hi>that the true Church cannot err. 2.</hi> They aſſume (which is alſo as hard, yea im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to prove, and ſo as falſe as the former) that <hi>they are that true Church which cannot err, or is ſo infallible.</hi> Whileſt they hold theſe two Poſitions, you were as good diſpute with a Poſt, as go about to convince them of Error, let them commit Errors (if it were poſſible) Seventy times ſeven more in Number and more groſs and abſurd in their Nature, than they do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well then, <hi>what ſhall or can be done for them for their recovery, and for preventing others from incurring the like Diſtemper of Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Unreaſonableneſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, By following the Directions here brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly given, and taken dextrouſly from them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, theſe two Maximes. Now this you will effectually do, if you put them to prove, or but to ſhew you, <hi>1. What is that Church that cannot err, and who is the Head of it?</hi> This you you will find an impoſſible Task for them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
<pb facs="tcp:199459:4"/>
                     <hi>2.</hi> Put them likewiſe to prove (if they could aſſign him, as they cannot) that the Head of their Church cannot err, either from Scripture, Reaſon, or Fathers, and you will find them at the ſame Loſs. And indeed no better help will they find from Succeſſion and Antiquity, than from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for that proof of their firſt Maxime.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> As to the ſecond Maxime, that falls of it ſelf, <hi>viz. That they are that true Church that cannot err.</hi> For if they cannot tell what is that Church that cannot err, or who is the Head of it, then cannot they ſay, they are that Church, For ſo they would ſay they know not what. But enough of this. For your Prevention and mine own, reade this moſt excellent and learned Treatiſe, written in <hi>Dutch</hi> by the pious and renowned Dr. <hi>Simon Epiſcopius,</hi> from thence tranſlated into Latin, and now rendred into Engliſh; which with the Bleſſing of God upon your ſerious Peruſal may tend to your Reducement from any Hanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings after Popiſh Trumpery, and Eſtabliſhment in the Truth, which is after Godlineſs; And the Bleſſing of God goe along with it. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>Amongſt the moſt of Chriſtians, eſpecially the Papiſts, or by which title they love to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:199459:5"/>be called, the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> when any Diſpute is had with them, we ordinarily meet with theſe two ſorts of Men. The firſt Sort is twofold: Some fear not roundly and with full mouth to affirme, that they will not be taught better, but that they will tooth and nayl and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſtick to their own Opinion; Inſomuch that though they ſhould ſee with their eyes that the Wall is white, yet nevertheleſs they would believe, their Church ſo believing and judging, that it is black; becauſe being forced by neceſſity, they find that they muſt ſo ſpeak. Whereupon although they find by all their Senſes, that is, ſee, ſmell, taſte, feel, hear, that the bread in the Euchariſt is nothing but bread, yet notwithſtanding they ought to be willing to believe that it is not bread; but only the accident of Bread, which cannot be taſted, touch'd, or ſmelt: Not conſidering that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do by this means give very many cauſe to doubt of every thing, and ſo to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the chief Foundation of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, that is, the Truth of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, which is built on this Foundation, that the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, and amongſt theſe <hi>Thomas,</hi> otherwiſe not over-credulous, perceived Jeſus Chriſt with all their ſenſes, ſaw, handled, heard, and veiwed him near to them; judging that that very thing ought to be an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199459:6"/>irrefragable Argument to themſelves and to the whole world, for to believe that Chriſt roſe from the dead not in ſhew and appearance, but really in his proper body. And they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed call this very thing mens believing thoſe things which they do not ſee; who yet do quite contrary here, whileſt they do not believe that very thing, which they ſee, touch, ſmell, hear and taſte. He that ſeeth not that this is a great Efficacy of errour, he ſeeth nothing at all: and if <hi>Thomas</hi> had followed this Rule, he might by the ſame Parity of Right have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that it was not Chriſt himſelf whom he beheld before him, into whoſe ſide he thruſt his Hand, and his Finger into the Prints of the Nails.</p>

                     <p>THere are others who ſeem not on ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be willing, or to dare roundly and openly to profeſs, that they will not be taught better; yea who proteſt to the contrary, dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that too groſs and ruſtick a Saying, and yet nevertheleſs they do not obſcurely declare,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199459:6"/>when they ſee their Forces reduced to Straits, that they neither can nor ought to yield to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opinion; much leſs receive any Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from thoſe whom their Church counts He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; and although they perceive themſelves in ſuch ſort wrapped in, that they can give no reaſon of their Belief or Opinion, neither from the Sacred <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor <hi>Councils,</hi> nor <hi>Fathers,</hi> and that their own Reaſons are ſo ſolidly and ſtrongly refuted, that they may, as it were, feel with their hands, that their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to the contrary are of no Weight or Force at all; yet they defend or maintain their own ſo obſtinately, that they will rather perſwade themſelves, that thoſe Arguments, though they ſeem ſolid, and altogether Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean, are more brittle than Glaſs, and do onely deceive under a ſhew of Reaſon, which others, more skilful than themſelves, would eaſily and with no trouble ſolve or anſwer, and ſo being blinded with a prejudicate Opinion, and alſo led with a Love and Reverence of their Mother the Church, they count them meer <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms;</hi> by this means indeed confeſſing on the one hand their own weakneſs, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, ſhewing their ſingular Conſtancy, or Obſtinacy in the Faith of their Church; contrary Arguments notwithſtanding, which preſs their minds, and force them to doubt of their fore-going Belief, yea to believe to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199459:7"/>the contrary. We may eaſily obſerve that theſe two Sorts of Men do not ſeek the Truth with a pious and honeſt Mind; but that they onely hunt after vain Glory, and the Praiſe of Victory gotten by any means whatſoever; deeming they have alwayes ſufficient Cauſes of glorying, whileſt they dare affirm they are not ſatisfied. That the caſe ſo ſtands, daily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſheweth. Nor is it to be wondred at: The firſt and chiefeſt Article of the Papiſts is this, That their Church cannot err; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that of all other Churches, that differ from their Church, we are to conclude that they err, and that as long as they perſiſt in their Errour, are liable to eternal deſtruction &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. With whom this foundation doth not remain wholly fixt and unſhaken, he cannot be a true Papiſt: but if any hold it tooth and nail, he openly profeſſeth that he is not willing to be taught better, although he ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his Errour; or if he make ſhew of ſome deſire to learn, yet doth he with his whole Strength and Might maintain his Opinion; although the Truth be propoſed to him as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and reſplendently, as the Sun-beams are wont to be, when the weather is fair and clear. This Foundation being laid, it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that to diſpute with a true Papiſt is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and endleſs; and that it cannot be hoped, that ſuch an one ſhould be taken off from his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199459:7"/>reſolution, or by Arguments be reduced into the right Way. Furthermore, a true Papiſt, as he renders himſelf unmeet to embrace the Truth, and to acknowledge his own Errour, ſo doth he unadviſedly caſt himſelf into a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth or Maze of inextricable abſurdities, out of which he is utterly unable to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or free himſelf, as it frequently uſeth to befal them, <hi>who receive not the Love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews, 2 Theſ. 2.10. And this appears more clear than the Noon-dayes Light, when any Diſpute is undertaken with them, even concerning any Point whatſoever of the Chriſtian Religion, nor is it neceſſary in many words to prove it.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IIII. <hi>That the Papiſts cannot ſhow, which is that true Church, which cannot err.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis chief and fundamental Point, which they have alwayes in their mouth, and on which they chiefly build, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot err, is a Labyrinth, out of which they cannot rid themſelves. For firſt, they cannot tell, nor intelligibly declare, which is that Church which they believe cannot err. Secondly, it is impoſſible for them to bring any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:199459:8"/>Demonſtrative Argument, whereby to perſwade themſelves, or any other impartial man (I do not ſay the Roman, but) that the Church cannot err. I evince theſe two: As to the firſt Member, I thus query with a Papiſt; When you ſay the Church or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot err, what do you mean by the Church? Do you mean all Chriſtians in general, who take Jeſus Chriſt for their Saviour, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to all his holy Commands, ſo that not ſo much as one of them can err? Doubtleſs he will deny it. For every one of them conſidered ſingly apart, yea and all conjunctly together, may err; For all are Members of one Body, which ought to have a viſible Head, from whom they ought to receive Spiritual Life, Senſes and holy Affections. Grant it be ſo, what then? Do you think that the Cardinals, Archbiſhops, Presbyters and Doctors are the Church? He will deny it again: Since all and every one ſingly may err, for the ſame Reaſon which we have ſhewn already. Do you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the Church underſtand a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, conſiſting of all the Cardinals, Biſhops and Doctors, as repreſenting the whole multitude of Chriſtians, whoſe Head this Council is? He will affirm it. But granting this, although it be grounded on no Reaſon; I will ask fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Do you believe then that this Council, as it is the Head of the Church, cannot err,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:199459:8"/>howſoever aſſembled, and whatſoever ſhall be decreed therein? In no wiſe, he will ſay; it ought to be lawfully convocated. By whom, ſay I? he will ſay, by the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Grant this, though it be void of Reaſon, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ground, yea and they determine or judge contrary to the Practice of the firſt General Councils. Is this Council, ſo convocated, that Church, which cannot err in its Decrees and Determinations? Or, is there that Head of the Church, to which no Errour is incident? Here he will ſtick or demur ſomewhat. For I will go on to query, thus. Put the caſe that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil decree any thing without the Conſent, yea contrary to the Judgment and Dignity of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether or no can it err therein? Here he muſt of neceſſity be wholly at a Loſs. For it is known, that not only diverſe Ancient Councils, both particular, and General, have paſt Decrees againſt his mind, and which did diminiſh the Pope of <hi>Rome's</hi> Dignity, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by many Councils in <hi>Africa,</hi> and alſo in the fourth General Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and many others. But further alſo it is evident, that the General Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> (held in the Year 1414. and called by the Pope of <hi>Rome John</hi> the 23. or as others the 24. At which were preſent more than a Thouſand <hi>Fathers</hi> deputed or appointed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and among theſe above three hundred <hi>Biſhops</hi>) decreed with unaminous Conſent, that the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:199459:9"/>Council was above the Pope; and therefore that it was in the power of the Council to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge Popes out of the Regiſter of the Church, and to degrade them; even as by the ſame Council were degraded three Popes, who then exerciſed the Office of the Popedom, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe even Pope <hi>John</hi> himſelf, who had called this Council, and that for four and fiftie, or according to others, ſeventie one nefarious Crimes, among which were theſe two; Firſt, that he had openly denyed the Immortality of Souls, ſuppoſing that Men dyed like Beaſts; to which he alſo added this Second, That he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that there was neither <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> nor <hi>Hell,</hi> as is manifeſt by the 11th Seſſion. Here the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt muſt ſay one of theſe two: Either that ſuch a general Council, is the Church that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err, no not even then, when it determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth any thing againſt the Pope, and to the prejudice of his Highneſs; as was done in this Council: Or, that ſuch a Council is not the true Church, and therefore is capable of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. If he ſay the Former, he will find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf entangled in a <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot; and beſides he will oppoſe the greateſt Part of the Popiſh Doctors, eſpecially the Jeſuits, who not only affirm that the Pope is above a Council, but alſo determine that that Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> is in this reſpect to be blamed, wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that the Pope was inferiour to a Council;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:199459:9"/>as is clear out of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and others: yea further, he will be forc't expreſly to confeſs that the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hath ſuceeeded to <hi>Peters</hi> Right and Power, is not the chief or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Head of all Churches; and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> may err in Faith, and ſwerve from the Truth. If he ſay the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he falls into a new Labyrinth; For then he doth not only contradict Councils, but alſo many and diverſe both Churches, and Popiſh Doctors; And namely the moſt ancient School of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which by ſome is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the firſt Daughter of the Church; which with the greateſt part of the French Churches, defends and approves of that decree of the Council of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> Howbeit ſuppoſe that he find no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in this matter, yet there he will ſtick, that even then he knoweth not, and cannot tell or ſhew that Church, which affirms that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err. For if a General Council be not the Church, or if it may err, and doth err, when it determines any thing againſt the Pope, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his approbation, I pray what is that which makes the Church not lyable to Errour? Haply he will ſay the Council is the Church, when it agrees with the Pope, and is confirmed by Him. Here again is a new Labyrinth, for it may fall out, and it very often hath, that the greateſt Part of the Council may not vote with the Pope. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine therefore that the greateſt Part of the Council do judge and decree ſomething, that the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199459:10"/>Pope diſallows of; Or that the Pope agree with the leſſer Part: Which Part in this Caſe makes the Church? Not the greateſt; For that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Pope. Doth then the leaſt Part make the Church? What Reaſon? What ſhew of Truth? What only, becauſe the Pope favours it? Then the Pope is the Church; For if theſe few make the Church, becauſe the Pope is on their Side; then if they were only two, who ſhould judge againſt a thouſand others? thoſe two with the Pope would make the Church? and what ſpeak I of two? Although there were only one, yea none, yet the matter would come to the ſame Iſſue, the Pope alone at length would be the Fore-caſtle and Poop, and the whole Church, which cannot err; Although he be even the veryeſt Knave in the World; Yea further, not only a Heretick but alſo an Atheiſt, who denies the Immortality of the Soul, Heaven and Hell; As Pope <hi>John</hi> the 23, of whom we have lately ſpoken of, did: For which Cauſe he was degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> with ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Sentence; that he was never after to be ſo much as counted for a Pope: as appears by the 11. and 12. Seſſion.</p>

                     <p>LO in what an intricate and inextricable Labyrinth the <hi>Papiſt</hi> ſticks, as to the firſt and chief Foundation of his Religion, to wit, that even to this day he cannot tell what that Church is that cannot err, or which is that Head of the Church that is not ſubject to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but he muſt contradict many and divers Catholick Churches and Doctors; Nor can the Mind of Man deviſe any means, whereby to bring Him out of this Maze of Errors into the way. For who ſhall determine and decide this without Errour? For either the Pope or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſhall determine this Queſtion, disjunctly or conjunctly, (that is, apart or together.) Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly it is impoſſible, becauſe neither of them can remove the Controverſie. For as long as it doth not appear, or it is not agreed, whether is the true Church which cannot err, neither can decide this Queſtion by a Peremptory and infallible Judgment: And if either ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this right to himſelf, it would juſtly be ſuſpected by the other Party: And he would in very, deed make himſelf a Judge in his own Cauſe. For if either deliver his Right unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199459:11"/>he will not only commit an unworthy Deed (For to deliver the Right of ſupream Authority in the Church is a wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Act: To whom that Right appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he muſt of neceſſity maintain the ſame.) but he will alſo thwart or go againſt all the Decrees of other Councils, wherein either a Council is defined to be above the Pope, or the Pope above a Council. And ſuppoſing this were done, yet will it follow from thence, that the Church of Rome hath for ſo great a ſpace of Time, either erred in ſo fundamental a Point; or ſtuck in Uncertainty and Doubt, not knowing what to determine concerning this Queſtion. It is a Deep without Bottom, into which hitherto the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been plung'd, together with all thoſe who think her the only Church wherein alone Salvation may and ought to be had. Let any one ſhew himſelf, that can free himſelf from thence with ſhew of Truth, and ſolid Reaſons.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>BUt ſuppoſe we indeed, that a Papiſt could tell the Head of his Church, (which yet,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199459:11"/>as hath been prov'd already, he cannot) by what Argument, I pray, will he aſſure both himſelf, and others that this Head cannot err? What way ſoever he takes to demonſtrate this, he will ſee that he falls into another far more intricate Labyrinth. For, that he may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That this Head cannot err, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that either he will believe it ſimply, and without Reaſon, or that he labour to prove it from the Sacred Scripture, or from the Fathers, or by Reaſons. If he will believe and perſwade himſelf thereof ſimply, and have others believe the ſame; all Diſpute will be forthwith ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and void: and if another on the contrary, will not believe the ſame, they will then be both alike, and both continue to ſtick in the Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of their own carnal Will. However it be, his Faith is not a Faith that cannot err; and conſequently, he cannot with Certainty rely thereon. If he endeavour to prove it from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he entangles himſelf much more. For firſt, it cannot be known, according to his Opinion, that the Scripture is the Word of <hi>God,</hi> except the true Church firſt certifie us thereof. If this be true as he believeth it is, and according to the Rules of his Church he is bound to believe, he cannot take Arguments from the Scripture, whereby to maintain that the true Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err; Or whereby to prove, that his Church is the true Church that knows not how to err. Secondly, ſuppoſe that it be even granted to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:199459:12"/>him, to fetch his Reaſons from the Scripture, he will then find himſelf much more entangled. For preſently the Queſtion will be concerning the true meaning of the Scripture. And the Queſtion that is raiſed, to wit, whether it be contained in the Scripture, that the Church cannot err, who ſhall by an infallible Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment decide it? Shall his Church? This is no wayes poſſible, becauſe the Queſtion is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the meaning of the Scripture, to wit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scripture gives to the Church this right or Priviledge of judging authoritatively, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly. But Thirdly: granting alſo that the Scripture doth give this Power to the true Church (which it doth not) yet the Queſtion will remain, which is that Church, which is the true Church, and to whom this Priviledge in Scripture is given. And in the Power of what Church ſhall the Power of deciding infallibly this Queſtion be? In the Power of the Roman? But the Queſtion is moved no leſs concerning it then others; beſides it cannot paſs Judgment in its own concern, more than another Church concerning its. If he go about to prove it by Reaſons, he will rove without the bounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Reaſons are not Scriptural, and we here treat or plead about the Scripture. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that Reaſons be oppoſed againſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; There will now ſtraightway reſult from thence a new Queſtion, Which Reaſons are ſtrongeſt and infallible, whereby we may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:199459:12"/>That the Reaſon taken from Succeſſion doth not belong to this Place, we ſhall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate hereafter. That a Papiſt ſhould emerge from hence, is impoſſible.</p>

                     <p>IF he will prove this from the <hi>Fathers</hi> their Writings, he falls into the ſame, and indeed into a more intricate Labyrinth.

If they ſay theſe or thoſe, it will ſecondly be ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Why thoſe rather than other, and why not all? For whoſo puts this Difference between the Writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> he does by that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Deed of his make the deciſion. And to whom ſhall it belong to make this Deciſion? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, ſuppoſe that there be no Controverſie raiſed concerning ſome, yet thirdly the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will remain ſtill, Whether thoſe writings,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:199459:13"/>which be attributed to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> be their Writings whoſe Names they bear? or whether they might not in Tract of Time through neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, through Deceit and Fraud be corrupted, and depraved? or whether they might not be patcht up with the ſuppoſititious Changling or forged Books of other Writers, as we ſee indeed done at this Day by the Writings of <hi>Tertullian, Juſtin, Hierome, Auguſtine, Chryſoſtome,</hi> &amp;c? Who ſhall judge between the genuine or true, and the ſuppoſititious or adulterate and falſe? For that there is required a skill in Tongues, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual or diligent reading, an acute Judgment and an accurate Examination of the Words and Phraſiologie or manner of expreſſion of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But ſuppoſing alſo, that there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie touching theſe Things; Then Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Queſtion will be, whether all thoſe Things, which the <hi>Fathers</hi> believed and wrote, are to be believed and received as true. If you deny it; I will query in the Fifth Place, why one more than another? If you ſay, becauſe they are all agreed in that or the one, then theſe Queſtions will forthwith ariſe. Firſt, wherefore ſhould all thoſe Things, wherein they are agreed amongſt themſelves, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted or held by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for undoubted and certain. The Second is, what are thoſe things concerning which they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, and which are to be embraced. To know this, you muſt attentively turn over the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:199459:13"/>of all the <hi>Fathers,</hi> Greek and Latine, from Head to Foot, for the which ſome Years ſpace is requiſite. And Thirdly, if any Doubt happen ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touching the Senſe of their Writings, as there is doubt made of the Scripture, or of their Phraſes and forms of Expreſſion, which they at that Time uſed, and now are both uſed and underſtood far otherwiſe, what end will there be? But paſſing this, ſeeing the <hi>Fathers</hi> agree among themſelves in this, that they would have neither their own nor any Writings of Men, except the Books that are Canonical, to be lookt upon as free from Error; yea, ſeeing they roundly confeſs that they may err, and by Conſequence would not that their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſhould be believed not to be lyable to Error, but do expreſly will, that they be tryed by the Word of God, deſiring that they ſhould be rejected if they agree not therewith; What ſhall be done then? What Certainty can there be had from their Writings againſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors? Certainly none at all. Yea rather, if we make Uſe of them for this end, that we may from thence be aſſured in our belief; we uſe them contrary to the Intention of the Fathers, and ſo againſt their plain and expreſs Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation and Prohibition, wherein the <hi>Fathers</hi> are all agreed.</p>

                     <p>Theſe are they, who have the Antiquity and Succeſſion both of their Doctrine and Church always in their Mouth: concluding for certain that they have born away the Palm, and gotten the Victory; if they may glory thereof. This they ſound forth as the Burden of the Catholicks Song. And which is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Higheſt Admiration, the chief Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Boaſters hereof are even thoſe, who haply not ſo much as ever throughly viewed the Books and Hiſtories of thoſe Men, from whence this Antiquity and continued Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is to be drawn and maintained; or if they have viewed them thorow, are yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs no wayes fit to turn them over without Affection and Prejudice, to wit, being wont, either fooliſhly to believe by a Proctour, to

This indeed is the readieſt Way, whereby any one may lord it over the Conſciences of ſimple Men, and having entangled them in a <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot, perſwade them any Thing. But let us propoſe both theſe a little more clearly. The firſt I prove thus.</p>
                     <p>None will be able to deny, that for the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:199459:16"/>the Antiquity not only of the Church, but alſo of a continued and uninterrupted Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Biſhops in the Church, there is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required, firſt a certain, undoubted, and accurate Knowledge of Authors both Greek, and Latin, and of all Hiſtories, that have been written of this thing. And Secondly, that to this knowledge there ought to be added a good and quick-ſighted Judgment, whereby exactly to diſcern their true and genuine Books from thoſe that are ſuppoſititious and adulterate; true Hiſtories from thoſe that are foiſted in and interlaced; thoſe that were compoſed with Partiality, out of Affection, and fore-ſtall'd O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, from thoſe they compoſed void of Partiality and Prejudice; to reconcile Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies, and faithfully to ſupply Defects. How much Pains, Trouble, and Time it requires, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſees; even amongſt the moſt learned for the whole Space of a thouſand and ſix hundred Years, there hath been none hitherto, who hath been able to perform it. The firſt of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indeed be ſo much as ſought for, much leſs found. Shall then the unlearned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful common People, who are counted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to turn over one Book of the Scripture, be ſufficient to undergo ſo great a Work as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately to enquire into all Hiſtories, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with even whole Barns may be filled, and Ships laden? The <hi>Laicks</hi> or lay-People in the the Papacie, who laying aſide the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:199459:17"/>alwayes talk of Antiquity and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, bewray a mind ſtupid and fooliſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; becauſe they know nothing more, yea happily much leſs of true Antiquity and Succeſſion than they do of the Scripture, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed being alike ignorant of both.</p>
                     <p>It is true indeed, that there may eaſily be drawn up a Catalogue and Index of Biſhops, where, in their Courſe and Order wherein they ſucceeded each other, they may be ſet down. But that is nothing to the Purpoſe. For the ſame do the <hi>Grecian,</hi> the <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Churches and others. The <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> doth it, ſayes <hi>Bellarmine</hi> from the Times of <hi>Conſtantine Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> in an uninterrupted Series; as alſo <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi> who continues the Names of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, even from the very Times of <hi>Andrew</hi> the Apoſtle. And yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> denies, and all the Papiſts with him, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> can of Right claim to themſelves a Succeſſion. The Succeſſion therefore of Perſons is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but it is required withal that it be lawful and ſuch, as that among the Biſhops who have ſucceeded one another, there have been no <hi>Heretick, Atheiſt,</hi> or <hi>Apoſtate</hi> among them. Firſt it is requiſite that it be lawful, for as the Papal Decree hath it <hi>Diſt.</hi> 79. If any by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or mens Favour, or Popular, or Military Tumult, without the unaminous and Canonical Election, both of the Cardinals and of the following Clergie, ſhall be inthron'd in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:199459:17"/>Seat; let him not be accounted <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical,</hi> but <hi>Apoſtatical.</hi> Secondly, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that among the Biſhops that ſucceed each other, there have been no <hi>Heretick</hi> among them. For, for this cauſe, as Cardinal <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and other Pontificial Doctors affirm, the Succeſſion of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Biſhops is not to be counted lawful, becauſe there have been <hi>Hereticks</hi> amongſt them. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>of the Marks of the Church, Cap.</hi> 8. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that will judge aright of the Succeſſion of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> he muſt of Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be moſt certainly aſſured of both theſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven according to the Canons of the Papiſts themſelves. But how is this poſſible? Who can undoubtedly know, whether all their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have obtained the Epiſcopacy lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Whether ſome have not obtained the Dignity of Succeſſion by Simony, that is, by Mony and Gifts (as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> deſired to do) or by Force, Arts and Wiles, by Factions and unlawful Suits and Bribings for the ſame? Again, if any deſirous to read their Hiſtories, do find of a certain that even thoſe Writers themſelves who have been moſt devoted to the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> do openly and roundly confeſs, that not only one or two, but that many and diverſe Biſhops of Rome, have climbed to the Pontifical Dignity, who having been condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of manifeſt <hi>Hereſie,</hi> have been counted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious <hi>Villains, Atheiſts, Schiſmaticks, Ruffians</hi>

For I demand who are they? and by what are they to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed? Why ſhall he derogate from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Pontifician Writers? For they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be termed <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or mortal Enemies to the Church of Rome, becauſe themſelves were ſworn Vaſſals thereunto, and ſome of them the greateſt Flatterers and fawners upon the Popes, and the pontificial Dignity. He is therefore forc'd to believe, that theſe Writers were impell'd and conſtrained by the Truth of the thing it ſelf, to write theſe things. And ſuppoſe that they were not Pontifician Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; What Reaſon ſhall perſwade that Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is to be denyed to them as not faithful Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, rather then unto others who were Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Pope and his Dignity? Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is no leſs able to with-hold a Writer from writing the Truth, than Enmity or Hatred is. He that will deliver Truth to Poſterity muſt write without all Affectation. And by what ſolid Reaſon, and which will convince,

He that conſiders theſe Things without Prejudice, ought to be induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that thoſe who endeavour to defend or ſhelter themſelves under Antiquity and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, do involve themſelves in a Labyrinth, in which one may eaſily be intangled, but hardly, nay nor indeed hardly be diſintangled or looſed.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This thing is ſo clear, that even the moſt learned Jeſuit Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proveth the ſame, acknowledging both theſe, 1. That
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:199459:19"/>the Argument concerning Succeſſion is not brought by his Party to prove that that Church, wherein is the right of Succeſſion, is therefore to be accounted the true Church; but onely to prove that that is not the Church, where there is not Succeſſion. And, 2. That Antiquity and continued Succeſſion doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all avail the <hi>Grecian,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan,</hi> nay nor all your <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Churches, to prove that they are a true Church, becauſe there have been ſometimes amongſt them Biſhops that have been hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, whoſe Thread therefore of Succeſſion hath been broken and cut off. From hence it moſt clearly follows, that though Succeſſion be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, yet the main Queſtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Truth doth remain ſtill. For if when Succeſſion is proved, it cannot infallibly be gathered and concluded, that that Church is the true Church in whoſe Hands the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is; And if farther it ought to appear for certain that no <hi>Hereſies</hi> or heretical <hi>Biſhops</hi> have broken off the Succeſſion; Reaſon it ſelf dictates, that Succeſſion is proved in vain, or at leaſt to no great Profit, unleſs we be thorowly informed concerning the Truth. For whileſt the Truth is unknown, it is impoſſible to know, whether any thing favour of <hi>Hereſie</hi> or no.</p>
                     <p>But who ſhall ſhew us the Truth? Or who ſhall moſt fully aſſure us thereof? Shall the true Church? But where, and which is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:199459:20"/>it? It cannot be. For when Succeſſion of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is proved, it is not yet certain and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that that Church wherein is Succeſſion, hath Truth on its ſide, or hath been alwayes free from <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and by Conſequence hath belonging to it the Right and Power to point out the true Church. What Church therefore ſhall it be, that ſhall infallibly ſhew us and ſay, that this is true, that that on the contrary is Heretical? For the Church that wants Succeſſion, according to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> cannot do it, nor the Church in which is Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, as is manifeſt from the precedent Grounds. What then? What End is there? It is impoſſible for a <hi>Papiſt</hi> to untye this Knot. To which I add this over and above; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that no heretical <hi>Biſhops</hi> have interven'd or ſtept in among thoſe that have ſucceeded, but ſuch who, as we have ſaid, have by Force, Faction, and popular Tumult, by Gifts and Bribes thruſt themſelves into the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Seat, where I pray will be the Succeſſion? Muſt we indeed believe that holy and ſaving Truth may better conſiſt with theſe nefarious Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes, than with Hereſie and Errour? Nay rather, if farther it be found in Hiſtories that at one Time, and that indeed for fifty, or eighty Years together, there have been two or three Popes, the one of which expunged the other out of the Catalogue of Chriſtians, call'd him in Reproach <hi>Heretick</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt,</hi>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:199459:20"/>pronounced him an unlawful Pope, cut off two of his Predeceſſors fingers, drew up out of the Earth Bodies already buried, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhamefully abuſed their Aſhes, caſt them into the <hi>Tyber,</hi> all which three Popes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times together have been condemned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded, and taken out of the Number of Chriſtians, by an univerſal Council, as falſe and unlawful Popes, as <hi>Hereticks</hi> and ungodly Villains, by whom notwithſtanding there were many Biſhops and Clergie men ordained, what End or Bounds of Succeſſion will the Thread of Connection find? For if it be ſaid for Examples ſake, That that Pope, which in the Times of the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was by common Votes ſubſtituted in the room of thoſe three Popes, which were depoſed by the ſaid Council, is to be accounted for the true Pope, who ſucceeded in the Room of the laſt that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed lawfull Pope, the <hi>Apoſtolical Sea</hi> being in the Interim vacant, and uſurped by Force, he will fall into a new Labyrinth; for that many of the <hi>Popiſh Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by Name, and all the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> do determine and urge, that this Council is ſo far to be judged for not lawful, in that it decreed that the Council was above the Pope, becauſe it was not approved of either by the Pope, that is, that moſt impious <hi>Knave</hi> and <hi>Villain, John</hi> the twentie fourth, or twentie third, who had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that Council, and was by the Sentence of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:199459:21"/>the ſame degraded, or by the Pope whom this Council conſtituted in his ſtead. For if this Council in that Reſpect be not to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for lawful, how then ſhall a lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion be proved? Had then this Council been in this Reſpect lawful, if that <hi>Knave</hi> and <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi> had approved of the ſame? This is ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be ſpoken, and more ſhameful to affirm, that therefore this Council was not lawful, becauſe it was nor approved of by him. Or had it then been lawful, if the ſucceeding Pope had approved of the ſame? But now, forſooth, it ſhall be unlawful, becauſe the Pope that was made by this Council, ſaid not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and thoſe like him, that he was ſubject to the Council, but on the contrary, <hi>Lucifer</hi>-like maintained that he was above the Council. Howbeit it is altogether credible that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Council was approved of by Him, before he was choſen for Pope. Who here ſees not a Circle of Abſurdities? However it be, if the Authority of the Council be no more than the Popes, it could not depoſe the Pope, and therefore thoſe ungodly <hi>Knaves</hi> Popes are to be reckoned among the <hi>Biſhops</hi> that lawfully ſucceed by a continual Succeſſion, not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Reaſon of their <hi>Hereſie, Atheiſm, Simony, Force and Villanies;</hi> or if there be granted an Interruption, there will now forthwith be no Succeſſion at all, upon the ſame Account, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> denies that the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:199459:21"/>of the <hi>Greeks</hi> is to be accounted law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. He that ſeeth not that the Papiſts are wholly at a loſs in all theſe Things, as in an endleſs Labyrinth of Errours, he truly ſeeing is blind. For howſoever the Caſe ſtands touching Succeſſion, the Queſtion concerning Truth will alwayes remain. To what Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe therefore do they enter into ſo intricate a Labyrinth, and take ſo great Pains for to prove a Succeſſion? One of theſe muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be concluded, either that the Truth is ſufficient to conſtitute a true Church, or that it is not. If the former be true; To what End is Succeſſion by theſe endleſs Windings to and fro proved? If the latter; What doth Truth avail, if it do not conſtitute a true Church? It is contrary to the Nature and Propertie of Truth not to conſtitute a true Church, whether thoſe who teach the Truth, have it by Tradition from others, or no, or at leaſt know not the Liſt of their Names, from whom they have it delivered to them. Gold will be Gold, although it have been hid, and buried in the Earth a thouſand Years. But you will ſay, it is requiſite that there be ſome, before I know Gold, to teach me that that is Gold. But, ſay I, ſhall the Church thorowly do this? But then there is required ſome one beſides, by whom I may be ſure that that this Church, which doth affirm that this is Gold, doth know it moſt exactly, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:199459:22"/>err therein. Who ſhall that be? Here the Papiſts make a Circle. We aſſert that the Scripture is Truth, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> granteth us. But yet it is the Prerogative of the Church, ſaith he, to tell us that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is Truth. But, ſay I, who ſhall tell me that the Church that affirms this, ſaith true? She hath not this Priviledge by Succeſſion, unleſs it clearly appear that ſhe never defected from the Truth. This cannot appear, unleſs I know what is Truth. If the Church her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſſume this, ſhe then ſingeth to us the ſame Song, and ſo the Church will be both Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and Judge, and that in her own proper Cauſe. Here will be no End of contending. And that is it, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> meant, in that moſt known Place, and commonly in the mouth of all the Papiſts, which they quote in all their Writings, with a very perverſe wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Senſe thereof, in his Book of Proſcript againſt <hi>Hereticks, Chap.</hi> 32. Where he thus ſpeaketh: <hi>But if any (Hereſies) dare inſert themſelves in the Times of the Apoſtles, that ſo they may be thought to have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Apoſtles, becauſe they were in the Apoſtles Dayes, we may ſay; that is, we may in ſuch Caſe demand of them the Succeſſion of which they boaſt, ſaying, Let them produce the Originals of their Churches, turn over the Order of their Biſhops, ſo running down by Succeſſion from the Beginning, as that firſt Biſhop, had ſome one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:199459:22"/>of the Apoſtles, or Apoſtolical men, who yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with the Apoſtles, for his Author and Predeceſſor,</hi> &amp;c. And a little after, <q rend="margQuotes">Let the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> feign any ſuch Thing: (which is to be noted, as ſerving our Purpoſe) yet though they ſhall feign it, they ſhall prevail nothing. For their very Doctrine compared with that of the Apoſtles, by its Diverſity and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, will aloud declare that it hath neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Apoſtle, nor <hi>Apoſtolical Man</hi> for its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. For as the Apoſtles would not have taught Things differing among themſelves, ſo alſo the <hi>Apoſtolical Men</hi> would not have publiſhed Things contrary to the Apoſtles, except it were thoſe, who revolted from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and taught otherwiſe. According to this Form therefore or Manner (note it well) ſhall thoſe Churches appeal, which though they can produce none of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Men,</hi> as their Authour, as being long after, and which laſtly are daily inſtituted: yet agreeing in the ſame Faith, (to wit with the Apoſtles or Apoſtolick Men) they are not the leſs deemed <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> by Reaſon of the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity or nearneſs of kin of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; That is, (according to <hi>Tertullians</hi> ſtyle) becauſe they agree with the Apoſtles in Doctrine.</q> Theſe words of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which the Papiſts ſo ſhamefully abuſe, and ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wreſt, do not obſcurely confirm what we have ſaid. For <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays three Things,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:199459:23"/>Firſt, <hi>that thoſe Churches, which have the Truth agreeable with the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, are no leſs Apoſtolical Churches then others, although they cannot ſhew their Succeſſion, for that only Cauſe, for that they have the Truth on their ſide.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that thoſe Churches which glory of their Succeſſion, and Original derived from the Apoſtles, and cannot demonſtrate it, are juſtly to be rejected, as thoſe who obtrude upon us that which is falſe. And</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which demonſtrate their Succeſſion, whether lawfully, or unlawfully, are not to be counted for true Churches, unleſs it appear, that their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is agreeable to the Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. What Churches agree therein, the ſame are</hi> Apoſtolical, <hi>although they be deſtitute of Succeſſion.</hi> This is more clear then the Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes Sun. The ſame affirmeth <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in that Place, which is alſo quoted as unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and contrary to the Meaning of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> by the Papiſts, in his Book which he wrote againſt the fundamental Epiſtle of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichee, Chap.</hi> 4. For when he had ſaid that he clave to the Catholick Church, wherein from the See of <hi>Peter,</hi> even to his Time, the Succeſſion of Biſhops and Prieſts had been deduced, he addes theſe words, which are altogether agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with our Judgment, <hi>With you</hi> (he ſpeaks of the <hi>Manichees</hi>) <hi>where there is none of theſe to invite, and detain me, there is onely the noiſe of the Promiſe of Truth, which indeed were it
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:199459:23"/>ſo manifeſtly ſhewed, that it could not be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, were to be preferred before all thoſe Things, by Reaſon whereof I am detained in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi> What could <hi>Auguſtine</hi> have ſpoken more clear to prove and ſhew, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Antiquity nor Succeſſion can avail, ſo as that any one ſhould be able to quit himſelf of the Labyrinth of Doubts touching the true Church, but that the Truth alone onely can, and ought to do it.</p>

                     <p>BUt ſome one will ſay, by this Means the Buſineſs indeed is made intricate, but there is no way ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to untie this <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot. But, ſay I, the Way to unty this Knot is not ſo hard, if we mind the Fountain, and very Original of it. For it ariſeth hence, that Men in this World deſire an outward Eaſe and Peace, an eaſy and delicate Religion, the which to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they ſeek for an infallible Judge ſpeaking in the Church, who Authoritatively may decide all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and to whoſe Award and Judgment the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Tongues of all ſhould be obliged or bound, ſo that it ſhall not be lawful to contradict it; and if any refuſe to acquieſce in his Judgment, he ought to be ſubdued by Force under Pain of Death and his higheſt Diſpleaſure: In a word, they endeavour of the Church of Chriſt to make a wordly Policy, and for that End forbid the Laicks and common People of the reading the Sacred Scripture, leſt Confuſion ariſe in the Church;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:199459:24"/>and the Clergie that are admitted thereunto, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that they read not the Scripture upon any other Terms or condition, but to underſtand, and interpret it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mind and Senſe of this Judge, or upon an expreſs <hi>Proviſo</hi> added, that they will not underſtand it otherwiſe, although they do underſtand it otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>This is the Spring and Original of this Evil, as long as this is not withſtood, the Labyrinth of Errours will remain. I grant indeed that at the firſt Veiw it doth not ſeem ſo unreaſonable, that ſome Judge ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Church, becauſe otherwiſe there can be had no end of Queſtions and Controverſies about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; But in very Deed and in Truth it is but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Appointment of thoſe men, who either endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to introduce a Tyranny, being deſirous of Rule; Or ſtudy their own Accommodation, being indeed Lovers of Eaſe more then of the Truth; Or at leaſt ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves partly under a Deſire of the Churches Tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, partly under the Pretence of Simplicity, Piety and Humility. The Matter is clear. For if God or the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, had thought it neceſſary or uſeful, that there ſhould be alwayes ſuch a Judge ſpeaking in the Church, they would have declared it even expreſly; and not only that, but they would withal clearly and palpably have pointed out who and where that Judge ſhould alwayes be, that we might not be deceived: And ſo might have Recourſe unto him, as unto a Place of Refuge. Yea farther, Chriſt would firſt and chiefly have taken Care of this, and the Apoſtles would have preſt it before all the Articles of Faith, becauſe all Things ought neceſſarily there to iſſue. For by ſuch a Judge all things might have been decided and compoſed. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed on the Contrary, becauſe neither Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles have done this, it cannot but be an humane Device and Project, built upon a wordly and outward Tranquillity and Conveniency, and favouring of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and uſurped Domination: For, for any one of his own Head to appoint ſuch a Judge, is a piece of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great boldneſs, and the higheſt Treaſon againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty that can be again, and fit or apt to enſlave
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:199459:24"/>the whole World under everlaſting Errours and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>As to what they ſay, That Chriſt delivered or gave the Keys to <hi>Peter,</hi> it is too light to build the whole Office of a Judge upon it. For ſeeing this is a Buſineſs ſo hard, and ſo highly concerns the whole World, even Chriſt, who came to ſave the World, would have declared, that this was the Senſe of his Words, ſaying; ſince I grant this Power and Priviledge to Peter, I will that all the reſt of the Apoſtles be excluded: and furthermore, that thoſe, who ſucceed <hi>Peter,</hi> not at <hi>Antioch,</hi> or at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> but only at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould inherit that Right or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Supream Judicature, and that all Chriſtians ſhould be bound or tyed to this Judge even to the worlds End or Conſummation of Ages. Thus Chriſt would have roundly, and clearly, expreſt his Mind and Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and indeed, who in a matter ſo arduous, would have expected other from Chriſt, who is a Lover of Men; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the whole Scripture from Head to Foot, had been nothing but a far-ſetcht Allegory, and continued Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it could nothing haue prejudiced us, becauſe the Judge of the Sentence thereof would be known; this one Thing if it were clear, and undoubted, all other Articles, although ſeemingly difficult, would be moſt eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>BUt Now, becauſe we ſee the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, have in the holy Scripture clearly and plainly expreſt all Things neceſſary for a Chriſtian to believe, hope and do, and will that the ſaid Scriptures, be with all diligence read over and inquired into by all that are deſirous of Salvation, and the Way that leads thereunto, and that withal with an accurate Examination
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:199459:25"/>and Tryal of all things and Spirits, whether they be of God, under the Pain of eternal Condemnation, and there be no one tittle any where in all their Writings extant, of any ſuch infallible ſpeaking Judge, alwayes to be in the Church, much leſs where he is to be found; We cannot but judge, that thoſe who deſire ſuch a Judge in the Churches, are moved thereunto by Conſiderations far otherwiſe then Divine, and that they render themſelves guilty of the greateſt ſin, and crime, to wit, of Dominion, and Tyranny or abitrary Power over the Word of God, and the Conſciences of Men.</p>
                     <p>That in wordly Concerns there are appointed Judges, by whoſe Judgment and Award we muſt ſtand, the Caſe is far different. For to their Judgment the Conſciences of Men are not bound, it is free for every man to believe, or judge of their Awards, Judgments and Deciſions as he pleaſe. The Award of the Judges is to be commended with our Mouth, not to be approved without Hearing. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all oftentimes their Judgments and Awards, a long while after, are by contrary Judgments and Awards null'd, or corrected. But when the Buſineſs is about Conſcience, Religion, Salvation, eternal Life, or eternal Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there ought to be no Judge there, but God, or he to whom God hath expreſly, and in Terms committed and given this Power, that a man may moſt rightfully ſay, if God hath given this Priviledge to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is the beſt, yea the only Church; and on the contrary, if it be evident, that God hath not given this Right, it is the moſt abominable, pernicious, and filthieſt Church that can be again upon the Earth. But, you will ſay, what End will there be then? This, ſay I, that the Word of God be <hi>impune</hi> and freely read by all, that no mans Conſcience be tyed to the Judgment of others; that one man love another, and by the beſt Means, out of the Word of God endeavour to inſtruct him, and ſo we expect that Time wherein the Lord God and Jeſus Chriſt, the only Judge of the Quick and Dead, will paſs A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Life and Death. By this means Conſciences will be free, Chriſtians all quiet and peaceble, and the Word of God the only Rule and Square of all Mens Actions.</p>

                  <p>THe Title-page of the Book preſented here to thy view, does ſufficiently inform thee, what in the general thou art to expect therein. The book is ſo little, and may be read over in ſo ſhort a time, that it is altogether needleſs to give a further account of its Contents. A large Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face me thinks would be uncomely, as being unproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the Building: And indeed thou hadſt not at all been troubled with any Proem how ſhort ſoever; If I had not a few words to ſpeak touching my work in this Engliſh Narrative. Although I was much perſwaded and well aſſured in my ſelf, that a Work of this kind might be of great advantage to thoſe of my Countrey men, who have ears for no other but their Mother tongue, eſpecially to them who have been abuſed by the Tongues or Pens of any, that have expoſed to obliquy and reproach the venerable names of theſe two reverend men, which alas! many have done, eſpecially as to <hi>Arminius:</hi> for the other, I mean <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> has not been ſo generally taken notice of, and his name was not here ſo publickly known, till the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which both of them contended and ſuffered for, was more commonly known and received amongſt us: Yet was
<pb facs="tcp:199459:28"/>it far from me to undertake of meer choice this endeavour, being not ſo well conceited of mine own abilities, as to thruſt my ſelf into this Imployment, nor ſo deſtitute of work as to need this for ſecuring and keeping my ſelf out of idleneſs; but by the importunate ſolicitation of ſome good men, I was prevailed with, and drawn unto it. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of Dr. <hi>Arminius</hi> is nothing elſe but that Elegant Latin Oration; here turned into plain Engliſh, which learned <hi>Bertius</hi> delivered in ſuch an Aſſembly, where he could not deliver untruths and remain undetected. I have indeed ſcarce pleaſed my ſelf in tranſlating ſo Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and verbatim the Teſtimonies there produced: Yet have ſo done, that ſome might not be diſpleaſed, who deem ſuch a tranſlation in ſuch caſes to be at leaſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. That which thou haſt here touching <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> is taken chiefly out of that excellent and large Preface, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to one of the Volumes of his Works, and written by <hi>Stephen Curcellaeus</hi> of bleſſed memory. In what I have done in the whole I am not conſcious to my ſelf of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs; neither am I unwilling to conſtitute mine Enemies judges of the performance, in caſe they be fit to examine, and not reſolved to be unrighteous in judgment. Reader, I ſhall no longer detain thee from the profitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of reading the following Narrative, which God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty bleſs to thy uſe.

                  <p>AS heretofore I have oft experienc'd, how hard and how difficult a thing it is, to ſpeak of Excellent perſons in an aſſembly of Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men: So now eſpecially I have thereof a ſenſible knowledge, it being my task at preſent to ſpeak in this place concerning that Reverend man Mr. <hi>James Arminius,</hi> Dr. of ſacred Theologie, and this after the ſad ſolemnity of his Funeral. For ſith that a good man is the rule and meaſure of things, he therefore; that would deſcribe to others ſuch a perſon, muſt be carefull to chooſe out and offer ſuch things to their view, by which humane life may receive advantage in the ſtudy of vertue. Good things that lie in ſecret, muſt be brought on the ſtage and made publick, and thoſe things which either Modeſty hath concealed, or Envy diminiſhed, or Calumny defamed, or which others through want of skill have not obſerved, thoſe things I ſay, when the curtain's drawn back and a light brought
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:199459:29"/>in, muſt be ſhown openly, and declared by words, that all may behold what in every one is moſt praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and what is fit for their imitation. Whence it comes to paſs, that the greater every ones vertue is, the more difficult it is to act the Orotors part in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him: for the greateſt Envy keeps company with the greateſt Vertue. And ſith that a wife man doth nothing without Reaſon; and it being difficult to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and unfold at every turn the principles and cauſes of particular actions, on which the judgment to be made of every thing does depend; it muſt needs be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to judge of excellent perſons, all whoſe life is full of diverſe examples, for the well inſtructing of others, how to judge, how alſo to live. And this alſo may be added, that he who takes upon him this imployment muſt very frequently have recourſe from the law to a mans life, and from his life to the law: for theſe need each the other, and as the law gives notice what muſt be done: ſo what may be done the life ſheweth. Now a wiſe man hath both theſe in himſelf; juſt after the example of Chriſt our Lord and Saviour, who firſt ſaid, <hi>Learn of me:</hi> and of his Apoſtle who thus admoniſheth, <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Chriſt</hi> And as heretofore <hi>Polycletus,</hi> not contenting himſelf that he had written a book, wherein he had noted all things to be obſerv'd by him that would artificially make the image or ſtatue of a man, did himſelf afterwrrds make the ſtatue of a man, leſt he ſhould ſeem to preſcribe that to others which himſelf hap not obſerved, and this ſtatue made publick he call'd the Canon or Rule, commanding that the lineaments of art ſhould be fetch'd thence as from a law of direction: So a good man, when he hath admoniſh'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:199459:29"/>others what they muſt doe, does firſt himſelf perform, what he preſcribes to others. Now it is hard, either to bring all a wiſe mans actions to their proper rule and law, or in one to find the Examples of all laws. But as for me, who am at this day to ſpeak in this honourable aſſembly of learned men, concerning the life and death of that Reverend and Incomparable man, Doctor <hi>James Arminius,</hi> not only thoſe difficulties, which I have now mentioned ſtand in my way, but many others alſo. My Grief, yet freſh, for the loſs of a friend preſſeth me; the conſideration of a ſad family, an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted wife, nine fatherleſs children diſturbs me; the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Univerſity moves me; but I am aſtoniſhed to think of the Church and Common wealth deprived of a man ſo greatly uſefull. All which things, in a wound ſo freſh, not yet skinn'd over, may eaſily put to a loſs the moſt eloquent and the wiſeſt man whoſoever he be. To what hath been ſpoken may be added, That he himſelf, whilſt he liv'd, greatly diſlik'd all pompous funeral ſolemnities: for he knew, that the firſt ſtep to the veneration and worſhiping of Saints was hence, and he deem'd, that it unbecomes us to deſire and uſe ſuch Solemnities, that had ſuch hazards attending on them. But ſeeing our preſent condition ſeems to be ſuch, that we need not in the leaſt to be afraid of this (for alas! hitherto are we come, that henceforth it may ſeem need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to uſe diligent care, rather to bring in devotion, than drive ſuperſtition out) And ſith that it concerns all men, that examples of vertue being drawn forth ſhould be propoſed for all to look upon, I have, according to the cuſtom, through the requeſt of friends, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate willing it, undertaken that difficult task, which I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199459:30"/>could not refuſe without the violation of Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the breach of the obligation of that friendſhip, which I have maintain'd with him from my very youth. Which things being ſo, I hope there will no reprehender of this my duty be found in this aſſembly of excellent oratours, in which there is no one but is able more grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and elegantly to perform this charge, than my ſelf. Notwithſtanding, I beſeech and moſt humbly intreat you, Magnificent, Reverend and moſt learned Auditors, to ſuffer the things I ſhall ſpeak to be of credit and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with you,</p>
                  <p>We have committed to the boſom of the earth the body of that Reverend man, Mr. <hi>James Arminius</hi> (or rather the temple of the holy Ghoſt) which has been ſhaken, worn, broken with labours, watchings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, diſeaſes, troubles. We have committed it, I ſay, in certain hope of a bleſſed reſurrection, which he himſelf, whileſt he liv'd, believ'd, and unto which he directed all his thoughts and purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>The place of his birth was <hi>Oldwater,</hi> a little Town long ſince made famous by the interflowing river <hi>Iſala,</hi> and the pleaſantneſs with the fruitfulneſs of the adjacent country, and the frugality with the induſtry of its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. He in this Town firſt ſaw the Sun in the year 1560. in which year the Conference at <hi>Poſſiack</hi> in <hi>France</hi> began; in which conference our Deputies plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe of two thouſand one hundred and ninety Churches, that did humbly and earneſtly deſire of the King, peace and tranquility, and the liberty of profeſſing their faith. This year, this <hi>Oldwater,</hi> as another <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> gave <hi>Arminius,</hi> as another <hi>Lacon,</hi> to the world: which Town notwithſtanding at other times brought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199459:30"/>forth <hi>John</hi> de <hi>Oldwater, Cornelius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alerius,</hi> and that excellent old man, whom ye here behold, Mr. <hi>Rudol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus Snellius,</hi> the ornament, not onely of his native place, but alſo of this whole Univerſity, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of them who are of the Senatorie rank and quality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arminius</hi> whileſt an infant loſt his father: His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a widow burthened with three children, lived all her life long in a mean eſtate, but honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>There was then in that Town a certain Prieſt, a man honeſt and grave, <hi>Theodore Aemylius</hi> by name, whoſe memory, by reaſon of his ſingular learning and holineſs of life, is yet bleſſed among the living. He, when he had got a taſt of a better and more pure doctrin in Religion, determin'd with himſelf, that he would not once more celebrate the abominable ſacrifice of the Maſs: therefore he oft changed his place of abode, and lived ſometimes at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Lovane,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at <hi>Colon,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht.</hi> He therefore took care, that this fatherleſs child, <hi>James Arminius,</hi> ſo ſoon as his age was capable of inſtruction, might be furniſhed with the firſt rudiments of the Latin and Greek tongue, and with the principles of true piety and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And when he perceiv'd in him ſome appearances of an excellent diſpoſition to vertue, he oft times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him; that all conſiderations of earthly things being layd aſide and contemned, he would give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to follow after God and his conſcience. He told him, that the time of mans life here is but ſhort; that there follows a condition after this life, which ſhould be eſtimated not by outward adverſity or proſperity, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199459:31"/>by the Eternity of happineſs or death. This Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, afterwards confirmed by a diligent reading of the holy Scriptures, and pious meditations, was ſetled upon his heart: And ſo he, through the hope of that life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent every labour, all hazards, with a glad and chearful mind. But after he had for ſome years thus liv'd o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> an unexpected calamity did oppreſs him, by means of the death of that good old Religious man, which the merciful God did ſuddenly mitigate; for preſently upon his death Mr. <hi>Snellius,</hi> who long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore flying the <hi>Spaniards</hi> tyranny, went to <hi>Marpurg,</hi> came as it hapned out of <hi>Haſſia</hi> into that Countrey. He therefore carried away with him into <hi>Haſſia,</hi> in the year 1575. this his Country-man <hi>Arminius,</hi> now deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all humane help and ſuccour. He was ſcarce ſet down there, when in the Moneth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the report of his Countreys deſolation is brought thither; He hears that the Town was taken by the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> that the Garriſon were ſlain; that the Townſmen were kill'd, and the Town burnt. With this report he was ſo much ſtricken at the heart and ſo greatly troubled, that he ſpent 14 whole days, in continual weeping and tears: Therefore as one impatient he left <hi>Haſſia</hi> and went with ſpeed into <hi>Holland,</hi> being determined ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſee the ruines of his Country, or to looſe his life.</p>
                  <p>When he was come thither, he found nothing but where the Town ſtood, and the ruines of it: and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that moſt of its Inhabitants were finally ſlain, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Mother, his Siſters, his Brothers and his Kindred: He therefore returned even on foot out of his own Country, to <hi>Marpurg</hi> in <hi>Haſſia.</hi> In the mean while this new Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>demy was erected and opened by the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199459:31"/>authority of the moſt Illuſtrious Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> which as ſoon as he underſtood, he prepar'd for a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney home. He came therefore to <hi>Roterdam,</hi> to which place were come from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> many faithfull Exiles, and moſt of <hi>Old-waters</hi> Inhabitants, that had eſcaped the ſword of a cruel enemy. At that time my Father <hi>Peter Bertius,</hi> was the Paſtor of that Church: but Mr. <hi>John Taffinus</hi> was the Princ's <hi>French</hi> Preacher and Counſellor; both theſe were wonderfully pleaſed with the young mans towardlineſs, readineſs and wit. Now ſeeing it was long before my Father was acquainted with learning (for he was 30. years old before he had any knowledge even of the Latin tongue) he upon requeſt of friends, took the young man very willingly into his houſe. Now it was the purpoſe of friends to ſend him to this new Univerſity; which occaſion my Father thinking not good to neglect, calls me out of <hi>England,</hi> when I was then a Student, applying my ſelf to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: both of us therefore were ſent together into this School: from that time there has been always between us a very great intimacy, familiarity and friendſhip: But I will not ſpeak of the paſſages of that time. This one thing I will ſay, that our young Scholars endeavour in learning and in the ſtudy of wiſdom, was ſo great, their reverence towards their Teachers ſo great, their zeal and earneſt affection in Religion ſo great, that greater could hardly be: But in our rank <hi>Arminius</hi> was one that excel'd the reſt; if any thing was to be written, if any thing to be ſpoken, <hi>Arminius</hi> was ſought for: If then aroſe any debate in learning that required a <hi>Pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mon, Arminius</hi> was conſulted with. I remember when Dr. <hi>Lambert Danaeus,</hi> our Profeſſor,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:199459:32"/>did commend him publickly for his natural endowments, and for his proficiency, and for his vertue; and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to enter on the ſtudy of Divinity with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, after his example. Why ſhould I make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here of his ſtudy in Poetry, in which he excel'd? Why ſhould I ſpeak of his ſtudy in the Mathematicks, and in the other parts of Philoſophie? He toucht no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of theſe, which he did not penetrate, he ſet upon nothing, which he did not happily finiſh.</p>
                  <p>Thus we are come to the year 1582. in which year the honourable Senate of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſent him away to <hi>Geneva;</hi> for his more abundant proficiency in learning. Whither when he was come, he heard that reverend old man, and of bleſſed memory, Mr. <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> expounding the Epiſtle to the <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

Him therefore above all others <hi>Arminius</hi> made choice of to imitate and follow, But ſeeing he could not forth with procure to himſelf the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſome Principal men in this School, and that (to ſpeak the truth) only upon the account of <hi>Ramus</hi>'s Philoſophy, which with earneſtneſs he defended pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and did alſo in private teach it to his auditors, he was provok'd to go to <hi>Baſil.</hi> Where what great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was confer'd, on the young man, what were the preſages and divinings of men of all ranks concerning his growing vertue, they are able to teſtifie, who were his fellow travellers, and companions in this his peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But he ſo heard theſe judgments and acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:199459:32"/>that he never waxt proud and arrogant, but ſhewed in very deed, that he was unwilling to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by ambition, but was willing by true vertue to come unto that, whereto he was deſigned by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Baſile</hi> in the harveſt Feſtivals the more learned Students are wont out of the ordinary courſe, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe-ſake to teach ſomething in the Univerſity, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties publickly. This labour our <hi>Arminius</hi> willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, for this he was praiſ'd by that reverend man, Mr. <hi>James Grinaus,</hi> who alſo oft times honoured his lectures by his Preſence. The ſame man alſo in publick diſputations, if any thing more weighty than ordinary were propoſed, or an intricate matter worthy a defender, did occur, was not afraid for honours ſake to call our <hi>Arminius,</hi> ſitting among a great number of Students; and (that you may know the candor of <hi>Grinaeus</hi>) to ſay. <hi>Let my Hollander anſwer for me.</hi> At this time <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was in ſo great favour and renown for his learning, that when he was about to depart thence for <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Theological faculty would have conferr'd on him, even at the publick charge, the title of Doctor, which he, eſteeming it too great a dignity for one of his years, did at that time modeſtly refuſe, and gave them thanks for their grace and favour.</p>
                  <p>When he was come back to <hi>Geneva,</hi> he found the minds of his friends more pacified towards <hi>Ramus's Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;</hi> alſo he himſelf thinking it ſomething meet to abate ſomewhat of his earneſtneſs, did ſo order himſelf, that all might eaſily perceive, that gentleneſs conjoyn'd with ſo great a wit brought no ſmall ornament to his age. There were at the ſame time in the City the Sons
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:199459:33"/>of the chief of our Nobility, moſt of which now are in eminent and honourable places in our Republick. When ſome of theſe were gone into <hi>Italy,</hi> others of them called home, he ſeeing himſelf alone, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all others his companions, excepting one, a man of very great dignity now in <hi>Holland;</hi> he alſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to go with ſpeed into <hi>Italy,</hi> being inclin'd thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eſpecially through the fame of <hi>James Zabarella,</hi> who then at <hi>Padua</hi> profeſſed Philoſohhy, and was greatly followed. For his ſake eſpecially he ſtayed at <hi>Padua,</hi> when he inſtructed in Logick ſome noble <hi>Germans.</hi> But afterwards he took a curſory view of the reſt of <hi>Italy.</hi> on which journey he ſpent not above eight months, and at <hi>Rome</hi> he was never abſent from that companion of his, who was to him as another <hi>Achates:</hi> for ſo it was agreed on before they went from <hi>Geneva.</hi> They ul'd the ſame lodging, the ſame table, the ſame bed; they went in and out together; and for the exerciſe of piety they carried with them the Greek Teſtament and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Pſalter.</p>
                  <p>I remember he was wont often to tell, That <hi>Italy</hi> brought to him many commodities and diſcommodities. Among the commodities he plac'd this eſpecially, That he had ſeen at <hi>Rome</hi> the myſtery of iniquity to be far more filthy and abominable than ever he had conceiv'd it in his mind: for he ſaid, that the things which are told or read concerning the <hi>Roman</hi> Court of <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> are Trifles in compariſon of the things which he had ſeen. Among the diſcommodities this; That the honourable Senate of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> was then ſomewhat offended at him for that his <hi>Italian</hi> journey, ſome in the mean while augmenting their their diſpleaſure, who clearly had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:199459:33"/>done better in ſuſpending their opinions till his return. Hence then an occaſion being taken, it was noyſ'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the common people, That he had kiſt the <hi>Popes,</hi> pantoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

(And indeed that Beaſt is not wont to give this honour to any but Kings and Princes.) Alſo, that he was accuſtom'd to hear the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> when as he never heard them; That he was acquainted with <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> whom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw; That he had abjur'd the orthodox Religion, whereas he was ready to contend for it even to the loſs of his life.</p>
                  <p>Now let our Youth that are pious and devoted to the Church learn this from anothers harm, That it is better never to ſet foot in <hi>Italy,</hi> than with ſo great an hazard of their repute to know the myſteries of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Not becauſe it is more dangerous for them to ſee <hi>Italy,</hi> than neighbouring <hi>Antwerp,</hi> or <hi>Bruſſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And it is ſafer to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> than <hi>Brabant</hi> or <hi>Flanders:</hi> but becauſe it is expedient to take all occaſions of evil ſpeaking from the adverſary, and all occaſions of evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmiſing from thoſe that are unadviſed and imprudent. And it is better to prevent an occaſion of offence, than to excuſe it.</p>
                  <p>Being come out of <hi>Italy</hi> he ſtayed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and ſome months after being called home he returned to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to his <hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Masters,</hi> furniſhed, <hi>through the grace of Chriſt, with a clear teſtimony</hi> from them of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and <hi>with a mind very well fitted to do office, if it might pleaſe the Lord God to uſe his miniſtry,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199459:34"/>for his work in his Church:</hi> For theſe are the very words of Mr. <hi>Beza's</hi> Epiſtle, the original of which I have in remembrance. At <hi>Amsterdam</hi> he did eaſily, with grave and prudent men, clear himſelf as to his <hi>Italian</hi> journey: but indeed the weak brethren went on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing againſt it, and in their aſſemblings blaming it till he himſelf began to be heard in the Church, in which as ſoon as he was beheld, it cannot be ſpoken, with how much reſpect men of all ranks flocked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hear him: For there was in him (as ye know) a certain incredible gravity mixed with gracefull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs. His voice indeed was ſlender, but ſweet, and loud, and piercing, but he had an admirable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive faculty. If any thing were to be adorn'd, he ſo did it, as not to exceed the truth. If he were to teach any thing, he did it with clearneſs and perſpicuity. If he were to diſpute any thing, he manag'd the ſame diſtinctly. Now the Melody and altering of his voice was ſo fitted to things, that it ſeemed to flow from them. And ſith he did not uſe a Rhetorical dreſs, and the Greeks boxes of pleaſant ointment: it was either becauſe his nature did abhor them, or becauſe he judged it unworthy the majeſty of Divine things; to uſe curles, and borrowed ornaments, when as the naked truth is of its ſelf ſufficient for its own defence: notwithſtanding he ſo efficaciouſly perſwaded by force and weight of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and by the pithineſs of his ſentences, and by the authority of Scripture it ſelf, that no man ever heard him, but confeſſ'd, that his diſcourſes much affected him. Some therefore at that time called him the poliſhing life of truth; others the whetſtone and ſharpner of wits; others called him the razor ſhaving off growing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:199459:34"/>errors, and nothing in Religion, and ſacred Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy was thought to ſavour well, that did not reliſh with <hi>Arminius.</hi> Alſo the Paſtors and Preachers themſelves of that City, men both learned and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, did reverence him for his learning, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly acknowledge themſelves to have been dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very much advantaged by his Sermons. And thus our <hi>Arminius</hi> with ſpread out ſayles, proſperous gales, a full company of rowers, and the good wiſhes of all that knew him, was carried towards fame and glory, when it pleaſed God to excrciſe his ſervant even with adverſity, and to make a tryal of his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and humbleneſs by the croſs and afflictions. Now 'tis a thing worth the knowing, to underſtand the beginnings and ſucceſs hereof.</p>
                  <p>There was carried about as it chanced in the hands of ſome pious men a little Book, written by ſome of the brethren of the Church of <hi>Delf,</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Beza,</hi> with this Title. <hi>An anſwer to ſome arguments of</hi> Beza <hi>and</hi> Calvin <hi>out of a Treatiſe concerning prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination on the</hi> 9. <hi>Chap to the</hi> Romans. This little book was ſent over to our <hi>Arminius</hi> by Mr. <hi>Martin Lidy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> of bleſſed memory, who had been formerly a Paſtor in the Church of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> but then was profeſſor in the <hi>Friezlanders</hi> new Academy, and by him <hi>Arminius</hi> was requeſted to undertake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> againſt the brethren of <hi>Delf.</hi> For <hi>Arminius</hi> was verily thought a man very fit for this buſineſs by Mr. <hi>Lidyus,</hi> who partly by report, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by experience knew the quickneſs of his wit, the ſharpneſs of his judgment, and what a wonderful
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199459:35"/>force and power he had both in preaching and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, Neither was <hi>Arminius</hi> altogether ſtrange from this deſign, being one that newly coming out of the School of <hi>Geneva,</hi> carryed about with him in his ears the ſound of Mr. <hi>Beza's</hi> lectures and arguments. He therefore betakes himſelf to the work; But whilſt he endeavours a refutation, whilſt he weighs the arguments on each ſide, whilſt he confers the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whilſt he torments and wearys himſelf, he was overcome by the truth. At firſt indeed he followed that ſame opinion which he undertook to oppoſe, but he afterwards by the guidance of the holy Ghoſt was carried over to that doctrin, which he conſtantly aſſerted even to the end of his life: Which was this; That Gods eternal Decree in predeſtination, was not to elect or chuſe preciſely and abſolutely ſome to ſalvation, whom as yet he had not purpoſed to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; (which Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> would have) neither was it, preciſely and abſolutely to elect ſome to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after the decree of their creation and the foreſight of their fall, but without an antecedent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt; (which the Delfian brethren held) Bus it was, To elect to ſalvation them of the created and fallen, who in time to come would by true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith anſwer to God calling them thereunto: Which by learned <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Nicholaus He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingius,</hi> and many more divines beſides, hath been aſſerted.</p>
                  <p>And although ſuch in times paſt hath been the liberty of our Churches, and even now is in very many places, that in this Argument, in which no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199459:35"/>ancient Synod hath ever determined any thing, any one of the multitude, and a Teacher, might always without offence to any one chooſe this or that: for to omit others, Dr. <hi>Jo. Holmannus Secundus,</hi> who by the very grave advice of excellent Divines, and eſpecially of the Lords Curators was called forth, after Mr. <hi>Pezelius</hi> and <hi>Mollenius</hi> and others were ſollicited in vain, taught it out of this very place: He imbraced (as we know) the opinion of <hi>Hemingius,</hi> and ſharply defended it. Not withſtanding there were not thoſe wanting at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> that in this matter were troubleſome to <hi>Arminius,</hi> and that accuſed him for departing from the common and received opinion in our Churches, but their vehemency and fiercneſs was ſuddenly repreſſ'd and appeaſ'd by the authority of the Senate, and the equanimity and moderation of the brethren; ſo that he always lived with his Collegues at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> quietly, yea friendly and brotherly, without any cloud of diſpleaſure, or hatred, or envy. And alſo this man of God was not only naturally diſpoſ'd to candor and gentleneſs, but alſo was moreover ſo formed and faſhioned thereto by the holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Spirit of Chriſt, that he did quietly bear with him that diſſented from him, and did not eaſily deſpair of any one, that was but willing to hear Chriſt ſpeaking in Scriptures: which by his divine moderation and equinimity we all knew, and have by ſo much the more admired it, by how much the further we, by the teſtimony of our own conſcience, perceive our ſelves yet to be from theſe good things.</p>

                  <p>Now when the Univerſity, deprived of her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors by the death of thoſe famous and excellent men, Dr. <hi>Junius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Luke Trelcatius</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſought for an <hi>Hercules</hi> that might ſuſtain this Orb (which in the mean while that Reverend man Dr. <hi>Francis Gomarus,</hi> being deſtitute of all his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, did as another <hi>Atlas</hi> ſupport alone) they by the general vote, and the publick conſent of their country, came to <hi>Arminius,</hi> who thinking of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs, was taking care for the church of Chriſt at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> which he had ſerved now fifteen years. But when they of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> profeſt that they could not be without his endeavours amongſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as they ſaid, they had chiefly him, by whom they might oppoſe the growing monſters of hereſies, it cannot be ſpoken how great then the conſternation of good men was. They variouſly deliberate and adviſe, no ſtone is left unturned. The Curatours of our Univerſity, <hi>viz.</hi> moſt noble <hi>Douſa</hi> and <hi>Neoſtadius,</hi> went themſelves in the publick name, together with that moſt honourable man, <hi>Nicholaus Zeyſtius</hi> the Syndick of our Common-wealth.

All theſe after a diverſe manner did earneſtly move and perſwade the moſt prudent Senate of this Common wealth, and the Conſiſtorie of the Paſtors and Elders. At length by many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, intreaties, and alſo the interceſſion it ſelf of moſt illuſtrious Prince, it was hardly obtain'd, that

Nevertheleſs petty Rumours of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, which moſt commonly are wont to ſubvert the beſt endeavours, did withſtand him, againſt which he ſet the ſhield of his innocency and candour and learning; Truſting in this, he confidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the bleſſing of God in that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. This matter therefore being heard and debated at the <hi>Hague</hi> before the Lords Curators in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſome grave Divines, it was found, <hi>That thoſe ſuſpicions were ill ſupported, and that there was no cauſe why any one ſhould have an ill opinion of that faithf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Thus then <hi>James Arminius</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Francis Junius,</hi> the Curators ſo commanding it. And that nothing might be wanting here to his credit and authority by reaſon of thoſe things that had been given out at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> it pleaſed the Eccleſiaſtical Presbyters to commend him to all godly, honeſt and learned men, by adorning him at his departure with a very fair teſtimony which ſoundeth thus.</p>

Wherefore ſith that Mr. Dr. <hi>James Arminius,</hi> a Reverend brother in the Lord, hath now requeſted this ſame of us, we ſaid, that we muſt by no means deny it him.

We therefore the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, together with the Elders of the ſame <hi>Claſſis</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> do teſtifie, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Mr. Dr. <hi>Arminius</hi> has been now fifteen years a member of our <hi>Claſſis,</hi> in which time he hath taught with much fruit ſound Doctrine purely, adminiſtred the Sacraments according to the Lords inſtitution, and propagated with great zeal the true and Chriſtian Religion, and by his diligent preſence hath always adorned our Claſſical meeting: alſo by his prudent Counſel hath with others compoſed matters hard and of great moment, hath always readily ſuſtained all impoſed burthens that reſpected the Churches Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, and hath by honeſty and goodneſs of life

Alſo to affect him with ſuch honour, as he, for his eminent and ſingular gifts ſhining in him, is worthy of; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ability to help forward his holy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; for the Glory of Gods name, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the School and Church.

                  <p>Have the Brethren honourably and laudably e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough teſtified of <hi>Arminius?</hi> thus then he came into the Univerſity. From this time all his Collegues have had experience of him as a moſt Falthful friend; The Schools as a Senator, Profeſſor. Rector; all the Students as a moſt gentle Father.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly after his entrance into the Univerſity he found, that the Students of ſacred Theology, did entangle themſelves in the thickets of queſtions,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:199459:39"/>and did follow Thorny Theormes and Problemes, the Scriptures being neglected. This evil, after the matter had been communicated to his Collegues, he ſtudied to amend, and did in a great meaſure effect it, for he brought back the antient, and maſculine, and mighty kind of ſtudying; and drew back as much as in him lay: the wandring youth to the Fountains of Salvation (thoſe pure and ſlimeleſs Fountains) that out of them Religion might be ſought for: not that Religion which being ſatisfied with wrangling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates or bare ſpeculation is gotten to feed the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie; but that which breaths out charity, and follows the truth which is after godlineſs, by which youth learn to fly youthful luſts, and having ſubdued fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allurements, to ſhun the pollutions of the world, and to do and ſuffer thoſe things, that make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between a Chriſtian and an Heathen. That ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>Except your righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſes, ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> he did repeat often to fix the ſame upon their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while the conſideration of Chriſtians ſo miſerably divided, and driven aſunder one from another, troubled him; he ſeldom ſpake of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tears, never without deep and hearty ſighs. He declared, that he wiſhed all the ſcattered members of Chriſt might grow together in one body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lords Commandment. He rightly judged, that the Papal Court ſought not the things which are of Chriſt; but the pleaſures, the honours,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:199459:39"/>the lucre, the pomp of this preſent world, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny over the ſouls as well as the bodies of men: And therefore that no man could or ought to conſult with that Harlot about matters of Salvation, and the eſtabliſhing of a common peace. He judged, that a great part of others were conſcienciouſly and piouſly affected; and were not divided not ſo much through an evil intent and purpoſe, as through doubtfull am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages or obſcurities in which many were driven from peace and concord by ignorance, many by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Anceſtours; many through pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or ſtiffneſs in thoſe opinions which either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had deviſed or long defended, many through ſhame of revoking and retracting their writings, laſtly many through prejudice and an ill opinion of their brethren. All which he thought might be remedyed, not by killing one another, but by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and by peaceable and friendly inſtruction, and by the example of an holy converſation. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both exhorted all to piety, and eſpecially took care of this, that when thornie queſtions and the huge luggage of vain and empty aſſertions were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and taken away, with which the Schools make an huge confuſed noiſe; thoſe things might be fetcht only out of the Scriptures which might be uſefull to bring them to the belief of neceſſary things, and to lead a good and bleſſed Chriſtian life. Which endeaur of his, Satan going about to elude and fruſtrate endeavoured to perſwade the inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that theſe things were done by him to get honour to ſhew the ſtrength of his wit. to cauſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:199459:40"/>innovations, to maintain contention and wrangling. Some therefore through ſuſpicion, that ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, moved again old <hi>Camarina,</hi> or were the cauſe of miſchief to themſelves; but the Profeſſors themſelves and the Colleagues, by the prudent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Curators did quell and quaſh it at its firſt ſhooting up: for credit to which matter I have thought that this <hi>Inſtrument out of the Acts of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>noverſity</hi> is fit to be produced.</p>

Oh horrible evil and viperous, and raiſed from the loweſt part of Hell! How oft have we heard him privately crying out even with ſighing, in the words of the Prophet? <hi>Wo is me my mother, that thou haſt born me a man of contention to the whole earth: I have neither lent on uſury, nor any hath lent to me on uſury, and yet all men curſe me.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he himſelf recalled himſelf to the incloſures of reaſon and tranquility, being always couragious, always patient and gentle towards his brethren, for whoſe ſake he was ready to ſuffer patiently, or as it were to devour, any reproaches whatſoever from the malevolent, and to forget or concoct them, not with a <hi>Cato's</hi> ſtomack, but that which was wrought in him by the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But his diſeaſe lurking in his bowels brake out eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the 7th of <hi>Feb.</hi> this year: which at that time ſo diſcovered it ſelf, that the Phyſicians forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with judged, that there was need of a ſlow and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous curation.

Therefore again and again, being called,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:199459:41"/>he with ſpeed went to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and there publiſh'd a famous profeſſion of his faith before many witneſſes, and after that laſt friendly conference he with this one thing after God and the teſtimony of his own conſcience comforted himſelf, that in a common aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of all <hi>Holland</hi> he was patiently heard by his moſt gentle Maſters, to whoſe prudence he attributed ſo much, that if he ſhould dye, he did hope, that there would not be thoſe wanting that would defend by the patronage of their wiſdom and favour the equity of that cauſe, which they once heard debated. Being carryed home from the <hi>Hague,</hi> he had ſcarce ſet himſelf to that which his maſters commanded, <hi>viz.</hi> To write out that exactly which he had propoſed in the friendly conference, but the force of diſeaſe again aſſaulted him by ſo much the more vehemently, by how much the more it had increaſed by delay and the weakneſs of his ſtrength.

                  <p>In the mean while the force of his diſeaſe daily increaſed, whilſt the moſt famous and moſt expert Phyſicians, Dr. <hi>Pavius,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sebaſtian Egbert,</hi> Dr. <hi>Henry Sael,</hi> Dr. <hi>Reener Bont,</hi> reſiſted it as much as was poſſible by Art and. Induſtry, and pleaſingly allured natures forces, but in vain; for the untamed obſtinacy of the diſeaſe ſcorned art it ſelf; For it was deeper planted than to be plucked up; it ſtirred up daily new Symptomes, Fevers, the cough, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the hypoconders, difficulty of fetching of breath, oppreſſion after meat, troubleſome ſleeps, an atrophie, the gout, and gave to him no intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of reſt: Afterwards came the Iliac paſſion, and the Colick, with an obſtruction of the left optick nerve, and an obfuſcation or dimneſs of the ſame eye; In the mean while calumny was as cruel, and abated nothing of its accuſtomed fierceneſs; of which I ſhall here mention, a cruel unworthy and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtance, which is fit to be recorded for after ages. When that dimneſs of one of his eyes was known, there were ſome that durſt account this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe puniſhments, which God threatens to his enemies, and wicked contemners of his name, and did affirm even from this puniſhment, that he was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199459:42"/>very wicked beyond others. And that there might not be wanting a pretext and colour to this ſo filthy and cruel a deed, the ſacred Books are consulted with, which a Chriſtian may not approach without reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and prayer. A place is found in the Prophet <hi>Zechary</hi> concerning the conſumption of the eyes and the whole body, ſounding thus. <hi>And this ſhall be the plague wherewith the Lord will ſmite all the people, that have fought againſt Jeruſalem: their fleſh ſhall conſume away, while they stand upon their feet; and their eyes ſhall conſume away in their holes, and their tongue ſhall conſume away in their mouth,</hi> Zech. 14.12. And another place; <hi>Wo to the Idol ſhepheard that leaveth the flock: the ſword ſhall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: His arm ſhall be clean dried up, and his right eye ſhall be utterly darkened.</hi> Chap. 11.7.</p>
                  <p>This place was wreſted againſt this holy ſervant of Chriſt, who indeed was afflicted in body; but in his ſoul always happy, but now even moſt happy and bleſſed. I tremble at the remembrance of ſo enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. and deteſtable, and ungodly deed. Who, art thou, oh man, that condemneſt thy brother, for whom Chriſt ſhed his blood? What doſt thou revile that ſervant of God with oracles fetched as it were from heaven it ſelf, whom they that ſhall come after us, and ſhall not be ungratefull, will acknowledge to have exceeding well deſerved of the whole Church of Chriſt? Why doſt thou take unjuſtly to thy ſelf a power of condemning thy brother, whom the Lord hath commanded thee to love. Hear him: <hi>Neither this man hath ſinned, nor his parents, but theſe things
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:199459:43"/>are done, that the works of God may be made manifeſt</hi> Hear him again; <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</hi> Hear the Apoſtle; <hi>It is with me a very ſmall thing, that I ſhould be judged of you, or of mans judgment. He that judgeth me is the Lord; Therefore judge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before the time, untill the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the heart: And then ſhall every man have praiſe of God.</hi> Art thou ſo aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of what ſhall happen to thy ſelf, as to know for certain, that thou thy ſelf ſhalt not be tormented with more bitter pain and dolour? And yet 'twas not his right eye that was amiſs; neither was it blindneſs, but only a dimneſs, and his arm was not dried up, but ſwelled. His tongue truly even to the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his life readily diſcharged its office. Thus things above, things below, things on the right hand, things on the left, things divine, things humane, wait together on theſe wretched Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants [Expounders of divine myſteries] to ſerve them when they will.</p>
                  <p>There were ſomes who playing on his name, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ani orbis amicus:</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> A friend of the vain world.] as if impiety was not ſometime bold to do the ſame on the ſacred name of Chriſt. Go your wayes for beetles, the unprofitable things of the world; What will ye not attempt to do on the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who have not ſpared God himſelf and the Lord of life? But I return to that which I made digreſſion from: He although tired with all theſe evils, yet notwithſtanding kept a ſtedfaſt courage and quiet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:199459:43"/>mind; He therefore never abated any thing of the pleaſantneſs, and comely gracefulneſs, and accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cheerfulneſs of his countenance, and candor of heart, his moſt ardent prayers aſcending to God for himſelf and the concord of the church. How frequent, how fervent in his ſickneſs were his ejaculations to Jeſus Chriſt? What joyes did he promiſe himſelf? With what perſeverance of faith did he expect his laſt day in the world? If the brethren did compoſe themſelves to prayers, and he himſelf was hindred by pain, he now and then deſired them to ſtay till he ſhould come to himſelf, that he might together with them perform this brotherly office.</p>

He therefore was committed, as ſoon as poſſible, to the care and diſcipline of <hi>Peter <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> a Schoolmaſter at that time famous; under whoſe manuduction he in ſo little time made ſo great a progreſs in Latin and Greek, that he was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by diverſe great men to the honourable Senate of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> which took and received him into the number of their Scholars, when his parents by the advice of Mr. <hi>John Kuchlinus</hi> and Mr. <hi>James
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:199459:47"/>Arminius,</hi> and by their perſwaſion, gave their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for at the firſt they were ſomewhat averſe thereto. When he had at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> run out his courſe there in the Grammar ſchool, the Curatours of the School did. in the year 1600, declare him by Solemn ſentence meet and worthy to be promoted to the Univerſity, that he might there apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to more high and manly ſtudies; He was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent away to the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> into the Colledge of the illuſtrious States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>West-friezland;</hi> in which Colledge was then Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that moſt learned man, <hi>John Kuchlinus,</hi> who when he was miniſter at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a firm and intimate friendſhip with the father of our <hi>Epiſcopius.</hi> This hopeful Plant had not been long in the Academical nurſery, but he loſt his moſt loving and beloved Parents; for <hi>Anno</hi> 1602 his father dyed, in the next year his Mother. He though much afflicted with this adverſity; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughtfull, and deſirous of his tranſplanting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome place of uſefulneſs to the Church of God, neglects not the preſent opportunity of furniſhing himſelf with things convenient and neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Wherefore having ſukt in as much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as was needfull, of the liberal Artts, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his endeavours for getting acquaintance with the ſecrets of Philooſophy; In which having ſpent about three years, he applyed himſelf moſt ſeriouſly to the ſtudys of Divinity, and with much diligence laboured therein; yet ſo as to have now and then a recourſe to Phyloſophy. At length, the Statutes of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199459:48"/>his Colledge, and his own privte affairs requiring it, heſought the title of a Mr. of Arts, and was, being after a ſevere examination judged worthy, adorned therewith publickly, in the year 1606, by Dr. <hi>Rodolphus Snellius,</hi> that moſt renowned Profeſſor of the Mathematicks there. After this he purpoſeth and reſolves to give himſelf wholy to the ſtudy of Divinity onely, in which he had already made a conſiderable progreſs. And ſeeing he could not accompliſh his earneſt deſire of viſiting forreign Univerſities, he continued yet two years and above at <hi>Leyden,</hi> where he was a diligent heare of the Divinity Profeſſors, namely, <hi>Francis Gomarus, Luke Trelcatius, James Arminius;</hi> and was ſo diligent and induſtrious in diſputations, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatory Sermons, that he left far behind him moſt of his equals for age and ſtanding, and was thought worthy to be called to the Miniſtry. But ſeeing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, eſpecially after the death of Dr. <hi>Trelcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that unhappy diſcenſion about Predeſtination, which afterwards gave a diſturbance to all <hi>Holland,</hi> did not onely ſecretly glow between the two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Profeſſors, but alſo at length break forth openly; and ſeeing our <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> ſhewed himſelf more addicted to the opinion of <hi>Arminius,</hi> he found therefore the Paſtors, who were of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, to be ſo diſaffected towards him, that they, when the honourable Conſuls of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> who had knowledge of his ſingular learning and good converſation, were deſirous of promoting him to the office of a preacher, did by delays, and other
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199459:48"/>their ſubtle devices, ſruſtrate and elude the good deſign of the Conſuls. <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> therefore in the year 1609, in which year <hi>Arminius</hi> dyed, left <hi>Leyden</hi> and went to <hi>Franeker,</hi> the <hi>Friezlanders</hi> Univerſity, whither he was drawn eſpecially by the fame of <hi>Jo. Druſius,</hi> Profeſſor there of the Hebrew tongue. Here <hi>Sibrandus Lubbertus,</hi> the Profeſſor of this Univerſity, took great offence at our <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> who was ſomewhat too hot and fervent in Theological diſputations, as young men of prompt and ready wits are wont to be. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a few moneths after departed thence, and went into <hi>France,</hi> where in a ſhort time he got ſo great acquaintance with the <hi>French</hi> tongue, that he was able not onely to underſtand it, but alſo to ſpeak <hi>French</hi> readily and purely. In the year 1610 he returned home, and found the Miniſters of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> no better affected towards him than before. But his verttue and learning, which could be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hid, and which were commended by clear and notable teſtimonies from the Churches and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities where he lived, break thorow at length all obſtacles, and ſo, that he was, with the conſent of the Claſſis, called by the honourable Senate of <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam</hi> to the Paſtoral office at <hi>Bleyſwyck,</hi> and hamlet belonging to their juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>After the death of <hi>Arminius,</hi> they of Calvins perſwaſion, whoſe notions of God, reprobating abſolutely the greateſt part of the world, to make known his power in making his creatures miſerable, had framed and diſpoſed to fierceneſs, begrn to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199459:49"/>the ejection of them out of their places who adher'd to <hi>Arminius;</hi> hereupon theſe perceiving the deſigns that were againſt them, did exhibite to the moſt illuſtrious Stales of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-friez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a certtain Remonſtrance (whence they were afterwards called Remonſtrants, as their adverſaries were called Contra Remonſtrants, from a paper they had written in oppoſition, and intituled, A Contra-Remonſtrance) in which Remonſtrance after they had declared their judgement comprehended in five heads or Articles, they humbly petition, that they in that belief and perſwaſion might be protected from the violence and force of their Adverſaries that much threatned them. Afterwards in the year 1611 was that famous Conference at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where by the appointment, and in the preſence of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Friezland,</hi> Six Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant, and as many Contra-Remonſtrant Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors conferred together about the things now in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. Forthe determining of theſe Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, the Remonſtrants then declared themſelves for mutual forbearance, but their adverſaries were for a Synodal Deciſion, as being no way doubtfull of out-voting them, in caſe the Remonſtrants were admitted members of the Synod, which indeed their adverſaries denyed them, when they had gotten a Synod, and the arm of fleſh on their ſide.</p>
                  <p>But the illuſtrious States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Friezland,</hi> knowing well, that onely the oppreſſion of the contrary party was ſought after, and that the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199459:49"/>controverſie was obſcure and difficult, made a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that both parties ſhould live together in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly communion, &amp;c. which decree had preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in peace, if might had not then overcome right, in caſting thoſe peaceable Governours out of their places, and ſubſtituting thoſe in their rooms who would be ready to doe what the Contra-remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants would have.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt return to our <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> who was one of the ſix Remonſtrants that managed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at the <hi>Hague,</hi> whereas on a famous Theater he made manifeſt his great abilities, both natural and acquired, and gave all men occaſion to conclude, that his knowledge and skill in the holy Scriptures, and in Theological diſputations, was not ordinary. After this, the fame of his learning and eloquence ſpreading in the United Provinces far abroad, he was ſolicited by diverſe eminent Cities, chiefly <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> to be their Preacher; but ſeeing they of <hi>Bleyſwyck</hi> would by no means be induced to give their conſent for his departure, he therefore continued in the exerciſe of his miniſtry among them. Put at length in the year 1612, when he was about 29 years old, he was called by the Curators of the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> to the Profeſſorſhip of Divinity there, in the place of <hi>Francis Gomarus,</hi> who voluntarily had deſerted it; Now although the modeſty of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> was ſo great, that he judged himſelf unmeet for a work ſo difficult in ſuch d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

In this evil day and contentious time, good <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> a man greatly deſirous of peace, a manſtudious, laborious and ſolicitous for the good of others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs. Now to give a few inſtances of this mans ſufferings, may not onely he ſerviceable to his commendation, they being the tryal and an evident proof of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and that which brought to light his Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fortitude and patience, wherein he greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:199459:50"/>they may expect, who are of the firſt in diſcovering errors, that have been long and more generally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced for truths, and for ſuch, which men have much gloryed in, as a treaſure more peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than others; and alſo to let us know what are the uſual effects of blind zeal in matters of religion, which will appear to be the worſt of Guides, leading men to moſt injurious, inhumane and barbarous practices.</p>
                  <p>We will begin with that which happened at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> in the ſecond year of his Profeſſorſhip; The ſtory in brief in this, <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> being at a church in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and (as they commonly ſpeak) ſtanding as a witneſs with others at the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of his brother <hi>Johns</hi> Daughter, <hi>Caspar Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> who then did officiate, asked him and the other witneſſes, <hi>Whether they did confeſs that to be the true</hi> and perfect <hi>doctrine of ſalvation, which was contained in the old and new Teſtament, and in the Apoſtles</hi> Creed, and <hi>which was taught in that church,</hi> to wit, of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> adding moreover theſe words: What ſay ye to theſe thing? <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> the chief among them, anſwered; That he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whatſoever was taught there according to the word of God, and the Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſtles Creed, to be the true and ſaving doctrine, as the words of the uſual form, out of which the interrogation is made, do intend; Which anſwer, though mild and modeſt, ſo moved the ſpleen of Mr. <hi>Heydan,</hi> that with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt he called him Young-man, and upbraided him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:199459:51"/>as one very audacious and preſumptuous in daring to ſpeak ſo in the Church of God. To which <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> again replyed, ſaying; That he would depart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f the Preachers would not admit that limitation, comprehended in the form of Baptiſm, where after mention made of the old and new Teſtament, and the Apoſtles Creed, theſe words are added, and conſequently is taught in the Chriſtian Church. But when <hi>Heydan</hi> had the ſecond time upbraided him with audaciouſneſs, and <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> made no further reply, he at length chriſtened the Child. And when <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> was going out, he was reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully handled, and called a ſeditious man, and a diſturber of the Church, by ſome of the baſer ſort, whom <hi>Heydans</hi> words had excited to ſuch oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious ſpeeches; and when he was gone out of the Church, he hardly eſcap'd beating or ſtoning, to which ſome inſtigated the youth that were then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But God out of his fatherly care protecting him, and reſtraining the fury of thoſe wicked men, brought him at length to his friends in ſafety.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this it happened in the ſame City, That a certain Black ſmith, ſeeing <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> paſſing by his ſhop, run out with a bar of Iron that he was forging on his anvil, and called him <hi>Arminian,</hi> and a diſturber of the Church, and ſo purſued him, as one having a mind to murther him, which danger he eſcap'd by flight and the aſſiſtance of others, that hindered and reſtrained this villanous Zealot.</p>
                  <p>Now if we ſhould here inſert a ſhort but ſad ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſome Contra-remonſtrants Plunderers, we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:199459:51"/>ſhould not go far out of our way, nor much digreſs becauſe <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> (ſo called) was the occaſion, and <hi>Rembert,</hi> the brother of our <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> was the perſon pillaged, and that in the time we have now under conſideration. The ſtory thus runs; There was in the year 1617, and on the 19th of <hi>February,</hi> a falſe rumour raiſed and ſpread abroad, that ſome Remonſtrants were met together to hear a Sermon in the houſe of Mr. <hi>Rembert Epiſcopius,</hi> who in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> was well known to be much addicted to the Remonſtrants opinions, and was for that cauſe much hated by the vulgar ſort, Upon this report many hundreds of vile perſons run thither, who firſt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the windows with ſtones, then with a bar break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the gate, enter the houſe in an hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and as a Company of Robbers, when they had drank up or ſpilled the wine and beer in the Cellar, they ſcorch and ſack the houſe, opening forcibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 12 cheſts, carrying away what was portable, for they ſtole thence a bag of money, wearing clothes, linnen, pictures, books, houſhold-ſtuff, plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what they could not carry away tore and broke, leaving nothing there whole and untouch'd, When they had emptyed the houſe, they begin to demoliſh it and make it an heap of rubbiſh, which they had done, if the coming of the Magiſtrate had not hindered them. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his wife eſcap'd their fury; ſhe by flying to a neighbours houſe; he by hiding himſelf on the top of his own houſe, whither he got by a ladder that he drew up after him. His loſs was eſtimated
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199459:52"/>to be above ſix thou and florans. And if he had not had ſome ſpace (while thoſe religious Felons were breaking open his doors) for the caſting of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and ſome part of his better houſhold ſtuff into a neighbours houſe, he had in that one day been well nigh ſpoyled of a good eſtate, and reduced to poverty, The other brother Mr. <hi>Jo. Epiſcopius,</hi> being alſo of the Remonſtrant perſwaſion, though he was not pillaged as his brother, yet was he often and much reproached by the dregs of the people, a ſort of malignant Zealots. But to return now to our <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> who was a ſufferer in his Relations, and Chriſtian Aſſociates, and met with many great perſonal afflictions, eſpecially at the time of the Dort Synod, and afterwards, of which we will here take a Superficial and curſory view.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1618 began the Synod of Dort, which how unjuſtly it carryed it ſelf towards the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants, the Acts and Hiſtory thereof, long ſince publiſhed; do, ſaith <hi>Curcellaeus,</hi> abundantly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy. We will briefly mention here a few things that more nearly touch our <hi>Epiſcopius;</hi> Although from that which happened not long before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of this Synod; namely the violent ejecting of thoſe Magiſtrates that favoured mutual forbearance, it was not hard to conjecture, that no good iſſue would attend this Synodical meeting; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> being invited to it by the Letters of the Illuſtrious States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and to ſit there with the other profeſſors of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> did with ſome other Remonſtrant Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:199459:52"/>make his appearance at <hi>Dort</hi> ſoon after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Synod; but the Synod, which was the adverſe Party, and which ſhamefully took to themſelves a power of judging in their own cauſe, permitted neither him, not any other Remonſtrants to be preſent in their aſſembly, but as cited perſons, appearing at the Syneds tribunal, and ſubmitting to the authority of the Synod, as having power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, when to ſpeak, when to hold their peace; and alſo at length, by majority of voices, to judge and cenſure them; Which how far from all equity it was, let all judge that have eyes to ſee, and are impartial. The Remonſtrants notwithſtanding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> leſt they ſhould ſeem wanting to a good cauſe, did yield to a neceſſity, and with a great and undaunted courage entred the Synod, and there <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> with great grace and Oratorial geſture (and as our learned <hi>Hales</hi> expreſſeth it) recited that excellent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is to be found in the Acts of the Synod, and in the ſecond volume of his works. After this, when the Remonſtrants declared, that they were ready to confer with the Synod, the Eccleſiaſtical Preſident in the name of the Synod anſwered, That they by an authority granted to them from the <hi>States General,</hi> were come together, not to confer with them, but to judge them; Notwithſtanding this, yet the Remonſtrants, having proteſted, that they could not acknowledge that Synod as a lawfull Judge in the preſent controverſy, becauſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of it conſiſted of their profeſſed adverſaries, who had already condemned them, and ſeperated
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199459:53"/>from them, did addreſs themſelves <hi>freely to propound, explain and confirm their ſentence or judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Synod, ſo far as they could and did judge neceſſary;</hi> and ſo to do, they were not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſpermitted, but alſo injoyned, by the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>States-General</hi> in their Citatory Letters. But when the Synod would again circumſcribe that liberty by theſe limits, to wit, that they ſhould propound, explain and confirm their ſentence or judgment, <hi>as far as the Synod ſhould judge might be ſufficient and ought to be;</hi> then could not the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants ſatisfy their conſciences to ſubmit to ſuch unequal and unrighteous conditions, by which they ſhould betray their cauſe, and ſo they were at length caſt out of the Synod, as perſons unworthy for the Synod any longer to treat withall.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the manner of their ejection I ſhall here adde ſomething out of the letters ſent from Dort to Sir <hi>Dudly Charleton,</hi> at that time Lord Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour from <hi>K. James</hi> to the <hi>States-General,</hi> and written by Doctor <hi>Belcanqual,</hi> a member of the Synod, and one of the Engliſh Colledge there, and of a different perſwaſion to the Remonſtrants, and by our own renowned Countrey-man Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> then Chaplain to the ſaid Embaſſadour, but for a time reſident at Dort, to obſerve the Synods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings there; The letters may be found in <hi>Hales</hi> his Golden Remains: When the voices ſaith <hi>(Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canqual)</hi> onely of the forreign Divines were asked (who are not above a third part of the Synod) then were the Remonſtrants called in, and diſmiſt with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199459:53"/>ſuch a powdering ſpeech, as I doubt not but that your Lordſhip hath heard with grief enough. I proteſt (ſaith he) I am much afflicted, when I think of it; For if the Remonſtrants ſhould write, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat the Preſident pronounced a ſentence, which was not the ſentence of the Synod, they ſhould not lie. The Civil Lawyers and Canon of <hi>France,</hi> who write much about the formalities omitted in the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> are exceptions of leſs moment then theſe; So neither was there above a third part of the voices asked, <hi>ex quibus ſententia fieri nequit.</hi> Neither was the ſentence conceived in writ, and approved by the Synod; And the bitter words of the ſentence were not the words of ony of the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, unleſs that ſome of them were ſpoken by one man onely. So far he; There are ſaith (Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>) ſome exceptions taken by the Deputies themſelves againſt Mr. <hi>Preſident</hi> his rough handling the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants at their diſmiſſion. The next day in the morning there was a private Seſſion, where a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was made of the laſt Synodical Acts, but when they came to the Act of the Remonſtrants diſmiſſion <hi>Ludovicus Croſius</hi> of <hi>Breme</hi> ſignifyed, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that Mr. <hi>Preſident</hi> in that buſineſs had been <hi>paulo commotior,</hi> [ſomewhat too paſſionate] and had let ſlip <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erba quaedam acerba</hi> [ſome bitter words] which might well have been ſpared; That in ſo great an act as that was, a little more adviſe and conſideration might have been uſed, That the Synod ought to have been conſulted with, and a form of diſmiſſion conceived and approved of by all,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:199459:54"/>which ſhould in the name of the Synod have been pronounced and regiſtred, whereas now the Synod ſtands indicted of all the unneceſſary roughneſs which then was practiſed. So far our <hi>Hales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the diſmiſſion of the Remonſtrants, the Synod prepared to judge them out of their Writings. But they in the mean time, whileſt the Synod was thus occupied, did privately, by the command of the <hi>States Deputies,</hi> compoſe for the confirmation of their doctrine, thoſe accurate Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which together with the Synodal Acts were publiſhed a little after, and deſervedly obtained the approbation of very many of the moſt learned men in <hi>Europe;</hi> One of chief authority when he had ſeen them, ſaid, That the <hi>Dort</hi> Synod had condemned the Remonſtrants; but they by their Writings had triumphed over the Synod.</p>
                  <p>And indeed one ſubſtantial argument is better than a thouſand Synodal ſuffrages. The chiefeſt part of theſe Writings ought to be aſcribed to the indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable induſtry of our <hi>Epiſcopius.</hi> That nervous Diſſertation touching Reprobation had for its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that learned and reverend father Mr. <hi>Charles Niellius,</hi> a preacher at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> To his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory we are indebted not onely for that piece, but for other things alſo in that volume; and debtours we are to all the reſt of them for that ſhare of their labour we have in thoſe Excellent Writings.</p>
                  <p>At length the Synodical Sentence againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants was pronounced, by which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as men of a corrupt Religion and depoſed and put out of Office.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:199459:54"/>
                  <p>The hard uſage of the Remonſtrants is not much to be wondered at, the Synods temper being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; For although there was much candour in ſome of the ſorreign Divines, eſpecially our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet there was much want of it in the Provincials. Not to ſpeak any thing of the unworthy uſage which ſome of the ſotreign Divines, experienced in the Synod, &amp; particularly they of <hi>Breme,</hi> who were upon the point of leaving the Synod, by reaſon of offences there given them; I ſhall onely in a word diſcover their ill diſpoſition towards the Remonſtrants: Prejudice prevailed much among the <hi>Dutch</hi> Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonſtrants; They are (ſaith <hi>Belcanqual</hi> in his letter of <hi>April</hi> 17) ſo eager to kill the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants, that they would make their words to have that ſenſe which no Grammar could find in them; We have given a remarkable Inſtance of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents</hi> good nature and manners. And as for <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus,</hi> the then viſible head of the Fataliſts, of what a froward and turbulent Spirit he was, I am even loth to expreſs in the words of <hi>Belcanqual,</hi> who thus writes to the Embaſſador; If the Synod (ſaith he) had wanted but two men, I mean <hi>Sibrandus Lubbertus</hi> [one of the principal Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonſtrant leaders] and <hi>Gomarus,</hi> we had wanted a great deal of contention, which I fear will not forſake the Synod as long as they are in it; They have their fits of madneſs by courſe; The laſt fit before this came to <hi>Gomarus</hi> his turn, and this day <hi>Sibrandus</hi> flew out with ſuch raving and fierceneſs of countenance, and ſuch unheard bitterneſs againſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:199459:55"/>our Colledge, as I deſire no other revenge on him, than the very ſpeaking of the words, which while they were in his mouth were checked by the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Politick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In another letter, thus; The Palatine Divines are the onely Magiſtrates Doctors next to <hi>Gomarus</hi> in all the Synod, and think every thing they ſpeak ſhould be taken for Text. Let me adde one paſſage more, wherein <hi>Gomarus</hi> is mainly concerned; In the buſineſs of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants of <hi>Campes,</hi> they of <hi>Breme</hi> perſwaded to a middle courſe in dealing with them. But <hi>Gomarus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Belcanqual</hi>) fell foully upon <hi>Martinus,</hi> a man very learned and very honeſt, who hath been ſo uncivily dealt with, that the Forreigners take much offence thereat, and he and his Colleagues have been ready to leave the Synod. Becauſe he diſlikes, as others do the Contra remonſtrants broad ſpeeches in many points, they uſe him with ſo much diſcourteſy; Though one be againſt the Remonſtrants in all the 5 Articles in ſubſtance; yet if he differ from them [the <hi>Dutch</hi> Divines] but in manner of ſpeaking, they hold him as not ſound. So far <hi>Belcan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ual,</hi> I thought not indeed to meddle with this buſineſs relating to them of <hi>Breme,</hi> but fell into it unawares, and cannot but learn from it, that if the Contra remonſtrants behaved themſelves ſo, in ſuch a place, againſt perſons who in the main were of their perſwaſion, then certainly the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants to whom they were profeſſed Adverſaries, had cauſe to expect from them none of the ſofteſt uſage. But there is one paſſage more that I ſhall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:199459:55"/>recite out of <hi>Belcanqual</hi> concerning <hi>Gomarus.</hi> In Seſſion 85, <hi>Gomarus</hi> in his diſquiſition of the 3 and 4 Articles, delivered a ſpeech againſt the <hi>Bremenſes,</hi> which none I think but a mad man would have uttered, and he delivered himſelf with ſuch ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his eyes, and fierceneſs of pronunciation, as every man wondered that the Preſident did not cut him off; at laſt he cut off himſelf, I think for want of breath, and then the Preſident gave <hi>cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrimo Duo Gomaro</hi> very many thanks for that his learned, grave and accurate ſpeech. The <hi>Exteri</hi> [the forreign Divines] wondered at it, <hi>Martinus</hi> onely ſaid, that he was ſorry he ſhould be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for his long journey. In another letter; All I will ſay my Lord, is this; There are two men in the Synod, <hi>Sibrandus,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Gomarus,</hi> who are able to ſet it on fire, unleſs they be lookt to. Thus far he: I ſhall ſay nothing of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Provincial or <hi>Dutch</hi> Divines, how they were at the devotion of thoſe that were chief Actors in the Contra-remonſtratical Tragedy.</p>
                  <p>We are come now to the Execution of the Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Sentence againſt the Remonſtrants; They being thus diſcharged, other Paſtors were put and ſubſtituted in their places, how unwilling ſoever the Chuches were to receive them; In ſome places theſe new Paſtors were brought in by force of arms. Now leſt the ejected Remonſtrants ſhould teach privately, therefore the <hi>States-General</hi> propoſe to them a certain ingagement, to abſtain in the future both directly and indirectly from all even private
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:199459:56"/>exerciſe of their Miniſtry. To which when ſome could not in conſcience ſubſcribe, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to perpetual baniſhment. Alas! who could expect ſuch cruelly amongſt Proteſtants, that had condemned Papiſts for the like unchriſtian practices? He that takes a view of our <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> and ſome others of the Remonſtrants in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, when this diſmal Cloud appeared, will ſee cauſe to admire their faith and fortitude. For ſo dear was the truth unto them, and their zeal for it ſo great, that a promiſe of the ſame wages or ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend which they formerly enjoyed, could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them (though ſome of them had but a very mean Eſtate) to oblige and bind themſelves unto ſilence, which was commanded them; Moreover theſe Generous ſpirits did with much boldneſs, after the pronouncing of the of ſentence of Baniſhment, defend openly to the <hi>States-General</hi> their own and their aſſociates Innocency, appealing to God, the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them that are unjuſtly oppreſſed, who would at the laſt day take cogniſance of their Cauſe, and judge, without reſpect of perſon, as well their Judges as them.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon theſe Stout Champions for truth were ſo haſtily carryed away by the <hi>States</hi> Officers out of the limits of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> that they after their detaining eight moneths at <hi>Dort,</hi> whether they were called, as they thought, to a free Synod, had not granted to them ſo much as one day, in which to bid their families fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and to ſet in order their domeſtick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,

                  <p>

How faithfully thoſe imployed their talent, received of God, I ſhall here paſs over in Silence, being now to ſpeak onely of <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> whoſe diſputations with <hi>Peter Wadingus,</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and his Antidote againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> do abundanly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his great care and diligence; And alſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, which he, with the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant Paſtors there, did compoſe and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, that they might ſtop the mouths of them who calumniouſly gave forth, that the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants cheriſht in their breaſt, monſtrous and ſtrange opinions, which they durſt not expoſe to publick view.</p>

                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:199459:57"/>departed thence into <hi>France,</hi> and inhabited ſometime at <hi>Rhoan,</hi> ſometime at <hi>Paris.</hi> If thou inquire how in theſe parts his time was ſpent, thoſe Writings of his there compiled, will give thee a worthy Account, in caſe thou art able to peruſe his Paraphraſe and Obſervations on the 8, 9, 10, and 11 <hi>Chapters</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans;</hi> alſo his <hi>Bodecherus ineptiens;</hi> his <hi>Examen Theſium Jacobi Capelli;</hi> his anſwer to to the Defence of <hi>Jo. Cameron;</hi> his Treatiſe of Chriſtian Magiſtracy. and that of free will, with other works of his, laboured there. He that with theſe conſiders his ſollicitous Care for the Churches of his own Countrey, which in this time of perſecution being deſtitute of their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paſtors, he by diverſe Writings and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles inſtructed, comforted and incouraged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in the Faith; alſo the many conferences he had with learned men concerning Religion, by which he endeavoured to bring them to a more accurate ſearch and inquiry after the truth; he, I ſay, that conſiders theſe things, will be ſo far from thinking that he had many waſt hours that he will greatly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where time was found for ſo many and great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievments. Here <hi>Stephen Cureelleus</hi> got with him his firſt Acquaintance and profeſſes that he heard him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſome hard points of religion, and learned ſo many things of him, that he always afterwards eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed it a ſingular happpineſs to him, that he had acquaintance with ſo worthy a man Here alſo <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> contracted ſuch a friendſhip with that moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:199459:57"/>man and eminent Mathematician, Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Mercer,</hi> which afterwards no diſtance of place, or length of time, could diſſolve or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. This was he that publiſhed this Book, by which <hi>Camerons</hi> opinion of Grace and free-will is examined, and intituled it, <hi>Epiſtola viri docti;</hi> and he that was ſo familiar a friend with <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> that <hi>Grotius,</hi> when he laſt left <hi>France,</hi> committed to him the moſt precious Treaſures he had, his Elaborate Manuſcripts, that by him they might be communicated to others.</p>
                  <p>At length <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> being deſirous to have a perfect Survay of <hi>France,</hi> who as yet knew little more than the Northern part of it, went from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Lyons;</hi> After that he viſited <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeille, Niſmes, Mompelier, Tholouſe:</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Burdeaux, Rochella, Poictiers, Angiers, Tours, Orleance,</hi> and other places. And when he had finiſhed his perambulation, he returned to <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rhoan;</hi> where when he had remained a while; and had heard that the fervour of the perſecution, raiſed in his own Countrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Remonſtrants, was ſome what alayed, he purpoſed to return thither. Leaving therefore <hi>France</hi> in the year of our Lord 1626, and in the eighth year of his baniſhment, he came to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> that he might with other brethren lay out his abilities for the gathering of that very numerous Church, which is there out of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed Remonſtrants: And that afterwards he might take care for other Churches in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:199459:58"/>Provinces.</hi> In the mean while by his Writings both in Latin and Dutch he ſtrenuouſly defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the truth. He publiſhed in Latin An Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Remonſtrants confeſſion; An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Eſſay of the <hi>Leyden Profeſſors,</hi> with other Books. In <hi>Dutch</hi> he wrote a Treatiſe of true Antiquity againſt the Papiſts; Three Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes againſt <hi>James Triglandius,</hi> then Preacher at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> ſince Profeſſor of Divinity at <hi>Leyden;</hi> with other books,</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond year after his return, he entred into a Matrimonial ſtate, (there being then hope of a more peaceable time) marrying at <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> that moſt choice and vertuous Gentlewoman Mrs. <hi>Mary Peſſer,</hi> the widow of Mr. <hi>Henry Niellius</hi> a Preacher of that City, and the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother of Mr. <hi>Charles Niellius</hi> above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. They lived together, but without iſſue, moſt piouſly, peaceably and comfortably to the end of the years 1641, at which time ſhe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed her courſe.</p>
                  <p>But before this in the year 1634 He went to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to be Preſident in the Remonſtrants Scholaſtick Nurſery or Colledge, which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected there to be as an Univerſity, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing of Youth in Divinity, that were intended for Miniſters of the Church,</p>
                  <p>How faithfully and diligently he exerciſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf here, we have an illuſtrious teſtimony from his copious, learned and moſt uſefull Theological Inſtitutions; and the Anſwer of 64 Queſtions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:199459:58"/>propoſed to him by his Diſciples; alſo from his learned and eloquent Sermons to the people; alſo his true Remonſtrant Divine; and his Anſwer to the 10 Dilemma's of a certain Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctor, and other works of his.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt he was thus labouring, ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions forced him to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where <hi>Anno</hi> 1639 he fell dangerouſly ſick, and for ſome moneths kept his bed, and ſo far was he gone, that there was little hope of his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. But at length God reſtored him to health, and ſo ſtrengthened him, that he returned to his charge at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently laboured among them as before.</p>
                  <p>After his return it ſeemed good to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants to publiſh a plain Catechiſm for the inſtructing of the more ignorant ſort. Then <hi>Abraham Heydan,</hi> at that time a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at <hi>Leyden,</hi> afterwards Profeſſor of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there, publiſhed an Examination of this Catechiſm, the defence of which our <hi>Epiſcopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> undertook, and finiſhed in a conſiderable large Volume, which came not forth till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death. For in the beginning of the year 1643, when he was well nigh 60 years old, he fell mortally ſick. His diſeaſe is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iſchuria,</hi> a dangerous ſuppreſſion of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> which was ſo pertinacious and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that for eleven days he could not make one drop of water; although ſome skilfull Phyſicians uſed the utmoſt of their art to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:199459:59"/>or at leaſt ſomewhat to mitigate this his mercyleſs and ſtubborn enemy. This Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (of which he afterward avoided but little) mixing it ſelf with the blood of the whole body, ſo corrupted the <hi>Craſſis</hi> and temperature thereof, that he could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly long ſubſiſt.</p>
                  <p>He lay ſick two moneths and above, and for ſome weeks before his death was deprived of ſight. Which loſs, whileſt there was any hope of his recovery, had been exceeding grievous unto him, had not his deep and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continual ſleeping leſſened the ſame; For ſometimes he complained of it to his friends that did frequently viſit him; ſaying, that he ſhould not be able any more to ſerve the Church of Chriſt,</p>
                  <p>At length on the 4th of <hi>April</hi> about the 8th hour in the morning, (at which time the moon was in the Eclipſe) he peaceably fell aſleep in the Lord. And the 4th day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was carryed forth (a great multitude of all ſorts of perſons following the herſe) unto the Weſt-Church, and was there interred by his wife. His death many much lamented, and many Epicedium's, or funeral Verſes of his praiſe and commendation, were publiſhed both in <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caspar Barlaeus,</hi> the moſt renowned <hi>Poet</hi> of that time, and who lived not full two years after him, publiſhed a moſt excellent <hi>Latin Epicae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:199459:59"/>in his commendation, which is prefixed to the firſt Volume of <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> his works.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have taken a ſhort view of <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi> from his birth to his death. His life was unblameable, and illuſtrious for zeal to the glory of God, and mans ſalvation; His Love to the Churches peace and concord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much to his commendation. He was indeed much converſant in Controverſies, not of choyce, but through neceſſity; He was often wont to complain of his conſtraint to this kind of exerciſe. His patient bearing of jnjuries, and readineſs to forgive, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his Maſter Chriſt, contributed not a little to his praiſe. In alms-deeds he was to his power ready and cheerfull; And ſuch was his modeſty and humble temper, that his rare endowments and great Atchievments he eſteemed as nothing. On his ſick-bed his Speeches were gracious, full of piety towards God, charity towards men and confidence in Chriſt. His name now and memory is bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them eſpecially, that without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice peruſe his works, that in two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Volumes are now publick in the Latin tongue, which I could wiſh that all men well underſtood, were it but to read <hi>Epiſcopius.</hi> I doubt not but there are many, who have much improved themſelves by his writings. Our famous <hi>Hales</hi> is not doubtleſs without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of whom this is reported by Mr.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:199459:60"/>
                     <hi>Anthony Farindon,</hi> his familiar friend: that he himſelf often told him, that at the well preſſing of <hi>Jo.</hi> 3, 16. by <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> he bade <hi>Jo. Calvine</hi> Good-night. It would be in vain for me here to inlarge, who am ſpeaking to thoſe, that through unacquaintance with Latin, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> are uncapable to ſee the great knowledge and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of our <hi>Epiſcopius:</hi> as for thoſe who converſe honeſtly with his Writings, they need not me. But I would not that any ſhould think of me, that I take all his ſayings for goſpel; No, I believe that his Writings as well as other mens muſt be read with judgment: for I nothing doubt, but that Errata's may be found in his works, not only ſuch that are juſtly imputable to the Tranſcriber and Printer, but ſuch alſo that are the Authors, who was ſubject to erre, though much more free from errors than many.</p>
